On October 11, 1994, he was returning from Chandigarh in a Government jeep bearing No. PNH 7944, that vehicle with an accident and caught fire. Deceased received injuries, due to which he died thereafter. It was allegation of the appellants that the accident had occurred on account of rash and negligent driving of the said jeep by its driver. 3. In the reply, factum of accident was admitted. It was, however, averred that the Driver had been driving the jeep only at a speed of 35 to 40 Kms per hour. He was neither negligent nor rash, as alleged. The accident had occurred, when front wheel tyre suddenly burst. It was further averred that the tyres of the jeep were in good condition. It was prayed that application for compensation, filed by the appellants, be dismissed. 4. On pleadings of the parties, following issues were framed by the Tribunal : \"(1) Whether the death of Tirath Singh deceased was caused in the accident due to the rash and negligent driving of Jeep No. PNH 7944 by its Driver Tilak Raj, now deceased ? OPA (2) To what amount, if any, the claimants are entitled to recover as compensation for the death of the deceased ? OPA (3) Relief. 5.

It is only to be seen as to whether the accident had occurred on account of rash and negligent driving of the jeep by its Driver Tilak Raj, who also died in the said accident, or whether the same has occurred on account of bursting of the tyre, which was in good condition? Regarding negligence of the Driver and as to how the accident had occurred, the Tribunal below has observed thus : \"11. After hearing the counsel for the parties, I find that in the claim petition, the claimants have nowhere stated that the accident took place on account of the worn out tyres of the jeep. It has only been pleaded that it took place due to the rash and negligent driving of the driver of the jeep. As far as rash and negligent driving, there are two eye witnesses, one from the side of the claimants and the other on the side of the respondents. AW2 Hukam Singh was an occupant of the jeep and he has stated that the jeep was coming at a speed of 35-40 kilometers per hour. To the similar effect is the statement of Kartar Singh RW1, who was also one of the occupants and he has also stated that the speed of the jeep was 35-40 kilometers per hour. Therefore, there is no escape from the fact that the jeep was running at a speed of 35-40 kilometers per hour and this speed cannot be said to be in any manner rash. No other negligence has been attributed to the driver of the jeep, except the speed. It cannot, therefore, be said that the jeep was being driven rashly or negligently. 12. Now coming", "page": 2}, {"source": "Darshan Vs State of Punjab (Tyre Burst Claim Payable).pdf", "chunk_id": 2, "text": "speed of 35-40 kilometers per hour and this speed cannot be said to be in any manner rash. No other negligence has been attributed to the driver of the jeep, except the speed. It cannot, therefore, be said that the jeep was being driven rashly or negligently. 12. Now coming to the tyres of the jeep, although the respondent has tried to prove that the tyres were purchased through Ext. R1 on 26.12.1991, but there is no cogent evidence that these tyres were put in the jeep in question. There are other jeeps also of the department and it may be just possible that the five tyres were purchased and were put in different jeeps, unless there is specific evidence to that effect. No record has been produced to prove that these very tyres were put in the jeep in question. Moreover, the tyres were purchased in 1991 and the accident had taken place in 1994. Therefore, it cannot be said that even if these tyres were put in this jeep, they were still in good condition. However, it was for the claimants to prove that the accident had taken place due to the negligence of the respondents in not maintaining the jeep in good condition, especially its tyres. It has been stated by AW2 that the tyres were in good condition. To the same effect is the statement of RW1 that the jeep was occasionally used and the tyres were in good condition. From the possible available evidence, it has been proved that the tyres of the jeep were in good condition. Therefore, the ratio of the cases relied upon by the claimants is not applicable in the present case. In Janula Begam's case (supra), there was evidence that the tyres were old and worn out and that the", "page": 2}, {"source": "Darshan Vs State of Punjab (Tyre Burst Claim Payable).pdf", "chunk_id": 3, "text": "has been proved that the tyres of the jeep were in good condition. Therefore, the ratio of the cases relied upon by the claimants is not applicable in the present case. In Janula Begam's case (supra), there was evidence that the tyres were old and worn out and that the bus was travelling at an excessive speed. Therefore, in those circumstances, it was held that it was a case of negligence and the owner was under liability to use serviceable tyres, while plying the bus. In Harnam Singh's case (supra), there was evidence to the effect that the tyres were worn out and in bad condition and further that the car was travelling at a speed. It was held that the accident was not inevitable and the owner was liable to pay compensation. In the present case, as discussed earlier, there is no evidence on the file that either the tyres were worn out or the driver of the jeep was negligent. In these circumstances, the only irresistible conclusion is that it was an inevitable accident and no negligence can be attributed Page 2 of 5 Law Finder DocId # 134701 Licensed to: Sh.Naresh Garg,Advocate Bathinda Punjab 12-06-2022 Law Finder", "page": 2}, {"source": "Darshan Vs State of Punjab (Tyre Burst Claim Payable).pdf", "chunk_id": 0, "text": "to the driver of the jeep. Therefore, the issue No. 1 is decided against the claimants.\" 6. Counsel for the appellants has vehemently contended that the finding, given above, is not correct. By referring to the sequence of events, which occurred at the time of accident, counsel contended that it was a case of rash and negligent driving and in the alternative, it is a case where for the accident, 'strict liability' is required to be fastened upon the respondents, as they have miserably failed to prove that the vehicle was being kept in a good condition. He prayed that by reversing the finding, referred to above, the claim application, filed by the appellants, be accepted in toto. 7. Prayer of counsel for the appellants has vehemently been opposed by Miss Nirmaljit Kaur, Additional Advocate General, Punjab. She, by referring to the statements made by witnesses produced by the claimants and also of the respondents, contends that the Driver was not negligent in causing the accident and that the tyres of the jeep were in good condition and further that accident can be termed as an act of the God, for which nobody can be blamed. She prayed that the appeal be dismissed. 8. This Court feels that the Tribunal below has erred in appreciating the evidence on record. It is a case where facts speak for themselves. As per admitted facts even if defence put up by the respondent is accepted (that the accident had occurred on account of the bursting of the front wheel tyre of the jeep), even then it can be said that the jeep was being driven in a rash and negligent manner. Admittedly, after bursting of tyre of the jeep, it covered some distance, went to the unmetalled portion of the road and struck", "page": 3}, {"source": "Darshan Vs State of Punjab (Tyre Burst Claim Payable).pdf", "chunk_id": 1, "text": "the bursting of the front wheel tyre of the jeep), even then it can be said that the jeep was being driven in a rash and negligent manner. Admittedly, after bursting of tyre of the jeep, it covered some distance, went to the unmetalled portion of the road and struck against a tree. Thereafter, it caught fire. Driver Tilak Raj died at the spot and could not be taken out from the jeep. Occupant of the jeep, Tirath Singh, succumbed to the injuries after the accident. If the jeep was being driven at the speed of 35-40 Kms, as stated by the witnesses, after bursting of the tyre, it could have been stopped immediately or otherwise the result, after striking the tree, would not have been so high, as to causing fire in the vehicle. In this case, the witnesses, produced by the claimants and also by the respondents are officials of the department. May be with a view to save the department from being burdened with compensation, they have made the statement that the jeep was going at a very slow speed. When facts are clear and tells the story, then causing of accident by driving the vehicle in a negligent manner can be presumed. 9. The Hon'ble Supreme Court, while dealing with a case of motor accident in similar circumstances in Pushpabai Parshottam Udeshi and others v. M/s Ranjit Ginning & Pressing Co. Pvt. Ltd. and another, AIR 1977 Supreme Court 1735, has observed thus : \"6. The normal rule is that it is for the plaintiff to prove negligence but as in some cases considerable hardship is caused to the plaintiff as the true cause of the accident is not known to him but is solely within the knowledge of the defendant who caused it, the plaintiff", "page": 3}, {"source": "Darshan Vs State of Punjab (Tyre Burst Claim Payable).pdf", "chunk_id": 2, "text": "normal rule is that it is for the plaintiff to prove negligence but as in some cases considerable hardship is caused to the plaintiff as the true cause of the accident is not known to him but is solely within the knowledge of the defendant who caused it, the plaintiff can prove the accident but cannot prove how it happened to establish negligence on the part of the defendant. This hardship is sought to be avoided by applying the principle of res ipsa loquitur. The general purport of the words res ipsa loquitur is that the accident \"speaks for itself\" or tells its own story. There are cases in which the accident speaks for itself so that it is sufficient for the plaintiff to prove the accident and nothing more. It will then be for the defendant to establish that the accident happened due to some other cause than his own negligence.\" 10. In the present case, no evidence in the shape of mechanical report has been placed on record to show that the accident had occurred due to bursting of the tyre. RW1 has specifically stated that he had not seen the burst tyre. He only heard a sound. Perusal of the evidence on record further indicates that an attempt appears to have been made by the witnesses, who are officials of the respondent-State, to conceal material facts. In the testimony before the Tribunal, it was said by the witnesses that the accident had occurred around 7.30 PM, whereas in the DDR, recorded by the police, Ex.A3, it has been said that the witnesses along with the deceased and the Driver reached Balachaur at about 8 PM. They took meal and then started for Hoshiarpur and accident had occurred in between 8.30 to 8.45 PM. None of the witnesses", "page": 3}, {"source": "Darshan Vs State of Punjab (Tyre Burst Claim Payable).pdf", "chunk_id": 3, "text": "in the DDR, recorded by the police, Ex.A3, it has been said that the witnesses along with the deceased and the Driver reached Balachaur at about 8 PM. They took meal and then started for Hoshiarpur and accident had occurred in between 8.30 to 8.45 PM. None of the witnesses has made an attempt to clarify as to what was speed of the jeep when they started from Balachaur. It was night time, naturally, with a view to reach Hoshiarpur, which as per information supplied is at a distance of 80 Kms from the place of accident, the Driver might be driving the vehicle at a high speed. Log book was not produced. No attempt was made to show that the vehicle was being checked up regularly. AW1, who was a summoned witness, has specifically stated that he had not brought any record regarding servicing/maintenance of the jeep. Once the trial Court has discarded defence of the respondents that the tyres, which were alleged to have been purchased on December 26, 1991, were put in the jeep, in dispute, then it was incumbent for the respondents to prove on record that the tyres were in good condition and the vehicle was being checked up periodically. Except mentioning that there was no mechanical fault in the jeep, no further averment was made in the written- statement, filed by the official respondents.

Ashadevi and others, AIR 1989 Madhya Pradesh 93, In that case also, the Hon'ble Supreme Court dealt with a similar situation, wherein, in a motor accident, a defence was taken that the same had occurred on account of some mechanical defect in the vehicle. By taking note of the facts of that case, it was observed thus: \"Even, assuming for the sake of argument that the driver was not negligent, in the present facts and circumstances of the case we can safely apply the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur, which is a rule of evidence departing from the normal rule that it is for the plaintiff to prove negligence but in some cases considerable hardship is caused to the plaintiff as the true cause of the accident is not known to him but is solely within the knowledge of the defendant who caused it, the plaintiff can prove the accident but cannot prove how it happened to establish negligence. This hardship is to be avoided by applying the said principle of res ipsa loquitur. The general purport of the words res ipsa loquitur is that the accident 'speaks for itself' or tells its own story. There are cases in which the accident speaks for itself so that it is sufficient for the plaintiff to prove the accident and nothing more. The present case is like that where the accident speaks for itself.\" 11. The facts of the present case are such that the defence, put up by the State, cannot be accepted.

The facts of the present case are such that the defence, put up by the State, cannot be accepted. The finding of the Tribunal, that the tyres, which were alleged to have been purchased on December 26, 1991, vide Ex.R1, were not proved to have been put in this jeep, was not challenged by the State by filing any cross-objection in the present appeal. Once it is so, in view of facts of this case, it was necessary for the respondents to prove that the vehicle and the tyres were perfectly in good condition. No evidence has been brought on record in that regard. Tyres do not burst in a routine and regular manner unless these are old or otherwise are not roadworthy. Nothing has been shown to the contrary. 12. In view of the facts, mentioned above, ratio of the judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in Smt. Kaushnuma Begum and others v. New India Assurance Co. Ltd. and others, 2001(1) RCR (Civil) 559 : AIR 2001 Supreme Court 485, can also be applied to the facts of the present case. In the that case, following were the facts : \"3. The accident which gave rise to the claim occurred at about 7.00 p.m. On 20.3.1986. The vehicle involved in the accident was a jeep. It capsized while it was in motion. The cause of the capsize was attributed to bursting of the front tyre of the jeep. In the process of capsizing the vehicle hit against one Haji Mohammed Hanif who was walking on the road at that illfated moment and consequently succumbed to the injuries sustained in that accident.\" 13.

In the abovesaid case, the Tribunal dismissed the claim application. The order was affirmed by the High Court by stating that the driver of the offending vehicle was not rash and negligent in driving the same. Their lordships of the Supreme Court laid down the following proposition for consideration :- \"8. We have to proceed on two premises based on the finding of the Tribunal. The first is that there was no negligence or rashness on the part of the driver of the jeep. Second is that the deceased was knocked down by the jeep when its front tyre burst and consequently the vehicle became disbalanced and turned turtle. Should there necessarily be negligence of the person who drove the vehicle if a claim for compensation (due to the accident involved that vehicle) is to be sustained ?\" 14. By applying ratio of the rule in Rylands v. Fletcher, 1861-1873 All England Reports 1, their lordships of the Supreme Court held that the owner of the vehicle is liable to make payment of compensation. While awarding compensation in that case, it was observed thus : \"20. No Fault Liability\" envisaged in Section 140 of the Motor Vehicles Act is distinguishable from the rule of strict liability. In the former the compensation amount is fixed and is payable even if any one of the exceptions to the Rule can be applied. It is a statutory liability created without which the claimant should not get any amount under that count. Compensation on account of accident arising from the use of motor vehicles can be claimed under the common law even without the aid of a statute.", "page": 4}, {"source": "Darshan Vs State of Punjab (Tyre Burst Claim Payable).pdf", "chunk_id": 3, "text": "to the Rule can be applied. It is a statutory liability created without which the claimant should not get any amount under that count. Compensation on account of accident arising from the use of motor vehicles can be claimed under the common law even without the aid of a statute. The provisions of the Motor Vehicles Act permit that compensation paid under 'No fault liability' can be deducted from the final amount awarded by the Tribunal. Therefore, these two are resting on two different premises. We are, therefore, of the opinion that even apart from Section 140 of the Motor Vehicles Act a victim in an accident which occurred while using a motor vehicles, is entitled to get compensation from a Tribunal unless any one of the exceptions would apply. The Tribunal and the High Court have, therefore, gone into error in divesting the claimants of the compensation payable to them.\" Page 4 of 5 Law Finder DocId # 134701 Licensed to: Sh.Naresh Garg,Advocate Bathinda Punjab 12-06-2022 Law Finder", "page": 4}, {"source": "Darshan Vs State of Punjab (Tyre Burst Claim Payable).pdf", "chunk_id": 0, "text": "15.

Learned Counsel appearing on behalf of the respondents-Insurance Company submitted that the deceased-Ritesh Bhanu Shali was unmarried boy aged about 26 years and the High Court rightly applied the multiplier of 13 as per the age of the claimants, i.e. parents. According to the respondents, the multiplier is to be applied as per the age of the deceased or as per the age of the claimant, whichever is higher but aforesaid submission cannot be accepted in view of the finding of this Court in the case of Sarla Verma (supra). 14. We have considered the respective arguments and perused the record. The questions which arise for consideration are : (i) What should be the deduction for the personal and living expenses of the deceased- Ritesh Bhanu Shali to decide the question of the contribution of the dependent members of the family; and (ii) What is the proper selection of multiplier for deciding the claim. 15. The question relating to deduction for personal and living expenses and selection of multiplier fell for consideration before this Court in the case of Sarla Verma (Smt) and others v. Delhi Transport Corporation and another reported in (2009)6 SCC 121. In the said case this Court taking into consideration the decisions in Kerala SRTC v. Susamma Thomas, (1994) 2 SCC 176; U.P. SRTC v. Trilok Chand, 1996(2) R.R.R. 718 : (1996)4 SCC 362; New India Assurance Co. Ltd. v. Charlie, 2005(2) R.C.R.(Civil) 550 SCC : (2005) 10 SCC 720 and Fakeerappa v.

Karnataka Cement Pipe Factory, 2004(2) R.C.R.(Civil) 619 SCC : (2004) 2 SCC 473, held as follows : \"(i) Re Question - Deduction for personal and living expenses : 30. Though in some cases the deduction to be made towards personal and living expenses is calculated on the basis of units indicated in Trilok Chandra, the general practice is to apply standardised deductions. Having considered several subsequent decisions of this Court, we are of the view that where the deceased was married, the deduction towards personal and living expenses of the deceased, should be one-third (\u2153rd) where the number of dependent family members is 2 to 3, one-fourth (\u00bcth) where the number of dependent family members is 4 to 6, and one-fifth (\u2155th) where the number of dependent family members exceeds six. 31. Where the deceased was a bachelor and the claimants are the parents, the deduction follows a different principle. In regard to bachelors, normally, 50% is deducted as personal and living expenses, because it is assumed that a bachelor would tend to spend more on himself. Even otherwise, there is also the possibility of his getting married in a short time, in which event the contribution to the parent(s) and siblings is likely to be cut drastically. Further, subject to evidence to the contrary, the father is likely to have his own income and will not be considered as a dependant and the mother alone will be considered as a dependant. In the absence of evidence to the contrary, brothers and sisters will not be considered as dependants, because they will either be independent and earning, or married, or be dependent on the father. 32. Thus even"}, {"source": "Amrit Bhanu Vs.

In the absence of evidence to the contrary, brothers and sisters will not be considered as dependants, because they will either be independent and earning, or married, or be dependent on the father. 32. Thus even if the deceased is survived by parents and siblings, only the mother would be considered to be a dependant, and 50% would be treated as the personal and living expenses of the bachelor and 50% as the contribution to the family. However, where the family of the bachelor is large and dependent on the income of the deceased, as in a case where he has a widowed mother and large number of younger non-earning sisters or brothers, his personal and living expenses may be restricted to one-third and contribution to the family will be taken as two-third.\" (ii) Re Question - Selection of multiplier 42. We therefore hold that the multiplier to be used should be as mentioned in Column (4) of the table above (prepared by applying Susamma Thomas, Trilok Chandra and Charlie), which starts with an operative multiplier of 18 (for the age groups of 15 to 20 and 21 to 25 years), reduced by one unit for every five years, that is M- 17 for 26 to 30 years, M-16 for 31 to 35 years, M-15 for 36 to 40 years, M-14 for 41 to 45 years, and M-13 for 46 to 50 years, then reduced by two units for every five years, that is, M-11 for 51 to 55 years, M-9 for 56 to 60 years, M-7 for 61 to 65 years and M-5 for 66 to 70 years.\" 16.

Admittedly both the parents, 1st appellant Amrit Bhanu Shali (father) and 2nd appellant- Smt. Sarlaben (mother) have been held to be dependents of deceased- Ritesh Bhanu Shali and, therefore, the Tribunal held that the Ist appellant and 2nd appellant have the right to get the compensation. On the date of the accident the 3rd appellant- Mamta was not married but by the time the case was heard by the Tribunal the 3rd appellant-Mamta had already been married. In these circumstances, she is not found to be dependent upon the deceased. Thus, both the parents being dependents, i.e., father and the mother, the Tribunal rightly restricted the personal and living expenses of the deceased to 50% and contribution to the family was required to be taken as 50% as per the decision of this Court in the case of Sarla Verma (supra). 17. The selection of multiplier is based on the age of the deceased and not on the basis of the age of dependent. There may be a number of dependents of the deceased whose age may be different and, therefore, the age of dependents has no nexus with the computation of compensation. 18. In the case of Sarla Verma (supra) this Court held that the multiplier to be used should be as mentioned in Column (4) of the table of the said judgment which starts with an operative multiplier of 18. As the age of the deceased at the time of the death was 26 years, the multiplier of 17 ought to have been applied.

As the age of the deceased at the time of the death was 26 years, the multiplier of 17 ought to have been applied. The Tribunal taking into consideration the age of the deceased rightly applied the multiplier of 17 but the High Court committed a serious error by not giving the benefit of multiplier of 17 and brining it down to the multiplier of 13. 19. The appellants produced Income Tax Returns of deceased Ritesh Bhanu Shali for the years 2002 to 2008 which have been marked as Ext.P-10-C. The Income Tax Return for the year 2007-2008 filed on 12.03.2008 at Raipur, four months prior to the accident, shows the income of L 99,000/- per annum. The Tribunal has rightly taken into consideration the aforesaid income of L 99,000/- for computing the compensation. If the 50% of the income of L 99,000/- is deducted towards personal and living expenses of the deceased the contribution to the family will be 50%, i.e., L 49,500/- per annum. At the time of the accident, the deceased-Ritesh Bhanu Shali was 26 years old, hence on the basis of decision in Sarla Verma (supra) applying the multiplier of 17, the amount will come to L 49,500/- x 17 = L 8,41,500/-. Besides this amount the claimants are entitled to get L 50,000/- each towards the affection of the son, i.e., L 1,00,000/- and L 10,000/- on account of funeral and ritual expenses and L 2,500/- on account of loss of sight as awarded by the Tribunal. Therefore, the total amount comes to L 9,54,000/- ( L 8,41,500/- + L 1,00,000/- + L 10,000/- + L 2,500/-) and the claimants are entitled to get the said amount of compensation"}, {"source": "Amrit Bhanu Vs.

We may give a brief factual background giving rise to the execution appeal. In relation to a construction contract between the parties, some disputes arose. They were referred to arbitration. The Arbitrator rendered an Award. The Award dated 12.8.1998 was challenged by the appellant DDA by filing objections under Sections 30 and 31 of the Arbitration Act, 1940. The respondent took an objection that it is the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 which was applicable and the objections preferred by the DDA were not maintainable. This submission of the respondent was accepted by the learned Single Judge who dismissed the objections preferred by the DDA as not maintainable. The DDA preferred FAO(OS) 93/2002 against the dismissal of the objections by the learned Single Judge. On 15.3.2002, in CM No. 219/2002 the Court stayed the execution of the decree which followed the dismissal of the objections preferred by the DDA, subject to the appellant DDA depositing the amount due and payable under the decree within a period of four weeks. The amount was directed to be kept in a short term deposit by the Registry. The aforesaid appeal FAO(OS) 93/2002 was admitted. An amount of Rs. 58,80,380/- was deposited by the appellant DDA and this position was recorded in the subsequent order dated 20th May, 2002 passed in the appeal.

The aforesaid application for seeking withdrawal of the deposited amount, however, remained pending, as no consequential orders were passed thereon. 4. Eventually, the appeal was allowed on 20th April, 2004 and the impugned judgment dated 2.8.2001 rejecting the appellant's objections to the award was set aside. The Division Bench held that the objections to the Award ought to have been considered under the Arbitration Act, 1940. It was, therefore, directed that the objections shall stand revived and that the learned Single Judge should decide the objections afresh according to law. No specific order was passed on the aforesaid application preferred by the respondent, namely, CM No. 443/2003. However, since the appeal had been allowed and the objections restored, obviously the respondent could not have been held to be entitled to withdraw the amount deposited by the appellant. Thereafter, the learned Single Judge heard the objections preferred by the DDA and the same were dismissed on 15.7.2005. Consequently, the respondent was held to be entitled to receive a sum of Rs. 14,40,386/- with interest w.e.f. 13.03.1986. The only variation made in the award was with regard to the interest granted in favour of the respondent. The learned Single Judge directed that : \"8.

The decree holder contended that the amounts, even if deposited by the judgment debtor, are short of the decretal amount. The Court directed that the decree holder may withdraw the amount deposited after seeking orders of the competent court and thereafter file the execution, if necessary. The Court observed that in the event the deposited amount is short, the decree holder/respondent herein would be at liberty to file execution for the remaining amount. 7. In the light of the aforesaid order, the respondent decree holder preferred CM No. 3680/2006 in FAO(OS) 93/2002 dated 28.2.2006 for permission to withdraw the money lying deposited in Court.

On the other hand, if the date on which the decree holder received the amount is to be the date reckoned, the payment not having been made within six weeks of the passing of the decree, the decree holder would be entitled to interest @ 18% per annum and then no question of over payment to the decree holder would arise.

In Hindustan Construction Corporation(supra) the DDA had deposited the amount pursuant to orders of the Division Bench before which appeal of the DDA was pending. It was held by a learned single Judge of this Court that the deposit of the decretal amount by the judgment debtor under the orders of the appellate court could not be construed as payment to the decree holder, as it does not satisfy the requirements of Order 21 Rule 1 Civil Procedure Code. The learned Single Judge relied upon P.S.L. Ramanathan Chettiar & Ors. v. O.R. M.P. R.M. Ramanathan Chettiar, AIR 1968 Supreme Court 1047. Similar was the position in A. Tosh & Sons India Ltd.

The submission of learned counsel for the appellant DDA is that the decretal amount computed with interest @ 18% per annum, amounting to Rs. 58,80,380/- having been deposited even before the passing of the decree on 15th July, 2005 there was no question of the appellant judgment debtor incurring any further interest, and that the interest stopped accruing against the appellant from the date the said deposit was made. Since the deposit existed on the date of passing of the decree dated 15th July, 2005, it is contended that the appellant was entitled to avail of the concessional rate of interest granted in the said decree.

Thus, in cases of execution of money decrees or award decrees, or rather, decrees other than mortgage decrees, interest ceases to run on the amount deposited, to the extent of the deposit. It is true that if the amount falls short, the decree holder may be entitled to apply the rule of appropriation by appropriating the amount first towards the interest, then towards the costs and then towards the principal amount due under the decree. But the fact remains that to the extent of the deposit, no further interest is payable thereon to the decree holder and there is no question of the decree holder claiming a re-appropriation when it is found that more amounts are due to him and the same is also deposited by the judgment debtor. In other words, the scheme does not contemplate a reopening of the satisfaction to the extent it has occurred by the deposit. No further interest would run on the sum appropriated towards the principal. 21. As an illustration, we can take the following situation. Suppose, a decree is passed for a sum of Rs. 5,000/- by the trial court along with interest and costs and the judgment debtor deposits the same and gives notice to the decree holder either by approaching the executing court under Order 21 Rule 2 of the Code or by making the deposit in the execution taken out by the decree-holder under Order 21", "page": 4}, {"source": "DDA Vs Bhai Sradar Interest Stay.pdf", "chunk_id": 2, "text": "court along with interest and costs and the judgment debtor deposits the same and gives notice to the decree holder either by approaching the executing court under Order 21 Rule 2 of the Code or by making the deposit in the execution taken out by the decree-holder under Order 21 Rule 1 of the Code. The decree holder is not satisfied with the decree of the trial court. He goes up in appeal and the appellate court enhances the decree amount to Rs. 10,000/- with interest and costs. The rule in terms of Order 21 Rule 1, as it now stands, in the background of Order 24 would clearly be, that the further obligation of the judgment debtor is only to deposit the additional amount of Rs. 5,000/- decreed by the appellate court with interest thereon from the date the interest is held due and the costs of the appeal. The decree holder would not be entitled to say that he can get further interest even on the sum of Rs. 5,000/- decreed by the trial court and deposited by the judgment debtor even before the enhancement of the amount by the appellate court or that he can re-open the transaction and make a re-appropriation of interest first on Rs. 10,000/-, costs and then the principal and 4 / 9 LAW FINDER Submitted By: Nitish Garg PDF downloaded from the online archives of Chawla Publications(P) Ltd.", "page": 4}, {"source": "DDA Vs Bhai Sradar Interest Stay.pdf", "chunk_id": 0, "text": "claim interest on the whole of the balance sum again.

But that is different from saying that in spite of his deposit of the amounts decreed by the trial court, the judgment debtor would still be liable for interest on the whole of the principal amount in case the appellate court enhances the same and awards interest on the enhanced amount. This position regarding execution of money decrees has now become clear in the light of the amendments to Order 21 Rule 1 by Act 104 of 1976. The argument that what is awarded by the appellate court is the amount that should have been awarded by the trial court and so looked at, until the entire principal is paid, the decree holder would be entitled to interest on the amount awarded by the appellate court and therefore he can seek to make a re-appropriation by first crediting the amount deposited by the judgment debtor pursuant to the decree of the trial court towards the cost in both the courts, towards the interest due on the entire amount and only thereafter towards the principal, is not justified on the scheme of Order 21 Rule 1 understood in the context of Order 24 Rules 1 to 4 of the Code. The principle appears to be that if a part of the principal has been paid along with interest due thereon, as on the date of issuance of notice of deposit, interest on that part of the principal sum will cease to run thereafter.

On the other hand, learned counsel for the respondent decree holder places reliance upon P.S.L. Ramanathan Chettiar & Ors. (supra) and also on the decision of the Supreme Court in Mathunni Mathai v. Hindustan Organic Chemicals Ltd., (1995) 4 SCC 26 to submit that the mere fact that the appellant-judgment debtor had created the aforesaid deposit in FAO(OS) 93/2002, it does not relieve the appellant of its liability to pay interest for the period after the deposit was made and also does not entitle the appellant to avail of the concessional rate of interest of 9% p.a. in accordance with the decree dated 15th July, 2005. The said deposit did not enure for the benefit of the respondent, and the respondent could not have withdrawn any part of the amount deposited in Court on its own, without either the no objection from the appellant, or by pursuing an execution petition. 14. Order 21 Civil Procedure Code deals with Execution of Decrees and Orders. Rule 1 prescribes the modes of paying money under a decree. It reads : \"1. Modes of paying money under decree - (1) All money, payable under a decree shall be paid as follows, namely :- (a) by deposit into the Court whose duty it is to execute the decree, or sent to that Court by postal money order or through a bank; or (b) out of Court, to the decree-holder by postal money order", "page": 5}, {"source": "DDA Vs Bhai Sradar Interest Stay.pdf", "chunk_id": 2, "text": "payable under a decree shall be paid as follows, namely :- (a) by deposit into the Court whose duty it is to execute the decree, or sent to that Court by postal money order or through a bank; or (b) out of Court, to the decree-holder by postal money order or through a bank or by any other mode wherein payment is evidenced in writing; or (c) otherwise, as the Court which made the decree, directs. 2.

Therefore, the issue that needs consideration is whether the amount lying in deposit in FAO(OS) 93/2002 would by itself tantamount to payment of decretal amount to the decree holder in accordance with Rule 1 Order 21. If yes, the appellants would be right in claiming a refund, if not, the appeal would be liable to be dismissed. 16.

If yes, the appellants would be right in claiming a refund, if not, the appeal would be liable to be dismissed. 16. Before adverting to the judgments relied upon by both the sides, it is necessary to analyze a few relevant facts. To ward off a possible execution of the decree that followed the dismissal of the objections to the Award by the learned Single Judge on 2nd August, 2001, the appellant judgment debtor deposited the decretal amount of Rs. 58,80,380/- in this Court in terms of order dated 15th March, 2002 in CM No. 219/2002 in FAO(OS) 93/2002. This FAO(OS) 93/2002 was allowed, as aforesaid, on 20th April, 2004 reviving the objections of the appellant. Therefore, there was no question of the amount deposited in the Court being available for appropriation to the respondent decree holder after the judgment dated 20th April, 2004. Even when the fresh decree was passed on 15th July, 2005, the amount already lying deposited in the FAO(OS) 93/2002 did not become available to the decree holder for appropriation automatically. It is not the appellant's case that it communicated its consent to the respondent for the withdrawal of the amount lying in deposit in the disposed of FAO(OS) 93/2002 at any point of time within a period of six weeks from the date of the passing of the decree dated 15th July, 2005. In fact, the appellant appears to have taken no steps whatsoever to either tender the decretal amount with concessional rate of interest within six weeks, or even otherwise to facilitate the withdrawal of the amount deposited in the disposed of FAO(OS) 93/2002 by the decree holder to", "page": 6}, {"source": "DDA Vs Bhai Sradar Interest Stay.pdf", "chunk_id": 2, "text": "15th July, 2005.

Consequently, even if one were to assume that the giving of the no objection by the judgment debtor to the withdrawal of the decretal amount from the deposit lying in FAO(OS) 93/2002 amounted to making payment within the meaning of Order 21 Rule 1 Civil Procedure Code, the said no objection came well after the expiry of the period of six weeks from 15th July, 2005. 17. In our view, the act of making payment to the decree holder under Rule 1 Order 21 Civil Procedure Code would require a positive act on the part of the judgment debtor of either depositing 'into the Court whose duty it is to execute the decree' or to make payment out of court to the decree holder through a postal money or through a bank or by any other mode ?wherein payment is evidenced in writing', unless the Court which made the decree otherwise directs. The payment made under a decree, to fall within the ambit of Order 21 Rule 1 Civil Procedure Code has therefore, necessarily, to be an unconditional payment by the judgment debtor to the decree holder either directly, or indirectly through the medium of the Court whose duty is to execute the decree. Mere deposit of the decretal amount in a Court, other than an executing Court can never amount to 'payment' and even where the decretal amount is deposited in the executing court, the judgment debtors liability to pay interest does not cease until notice contemplated by sub-rule(2) of Rule 1 Order 21 is given.

If resort to the execution process of the Court is required to be made by the decree holder, and the decretal amount is recovered in pursuance of the order of attachment of the accounts of the judgment debtor, and/or sale of assets of the judgment debtor, such realisation of the decretal amount would not amount to payment of the decretal amount under Rule 1 Order 21. 18. When the learned Single Judge, while passing the decree dated 15th July, 2005, granted remission in interest to the judgment debtor on the condition of the payment being made to the decree holder within six weeks, the Court did not intend that the decree holder should have to take out execution proceedings, or to chase the judgment debtor to realise the payment under the decree. It was for the judgment debtor to itself come forward and tender the decretal amount, or at least to facilitate the withdrawal of the amount deposited by the judgment debtor in Court, within the time granted by the Court. It is not the appellants case, and it could not have been its case that upon passing of the decree dated 15th July, 2005, the decree holder could have on its own approached the appellant Court for withdrawal of the decretal amount from the deposit lying in FAO(OS) 93/2002.

The submission of the appellant judgment debtor that the mere deposit of the amount in the FAO(OS) 93/2002 resulted in the stoppage of accrual of any further interest from the date of deposit is also meritless. Even in cases where the decretal amount flows into the coffers of the decree holder, subject to the decree holder being required to furnish a security during the pendency of an appeal, the Supreme Court has held in P.S.L. Ramanathan Chettiar & Ors. (supra) that such payment does not tantamount to payment of money under the decree. In paras 12 and 13 of P.S.L. Ramanathan Chettiar & Ors. (supra), the Hon'ble Supreme Court held as follows : \"12.

The real effect of deposit of money in court as was done in this case is to put the money beyond the reach of the parties pending the disposal of the appeal. The decree- holder could only take it out on furnishing security which means that the payment was not in satisfaction of the decree and the security could be proceeded against by the judgment-debtor in case of his success in the appeal. Pending the determination of the same, it was beyond the reach of the judgment-debtor.\" 20. The situation in the present case is still worse for the appellant, inasmuch as, the amount deposited in FAO(OS) 93/2002 was not released to the respondent till after the passing of the order dated 27.4.2006.

In Mathunni Mathai (supra) though the judgment debtor had made the deposit in the executing Court, but intimation in respect thereof was not given to the decree holder. The Supreme Court held that the payment could not be deemed to have been appropriated towards principal unless the decree holder admits it to be so. While examining Order 21 Rule 1, 2 and Civil Procedure Code, the Supreme Court observed : \".......The amended Sub-rule (2) removes the doubt if there was any that the judgment-debtor is not absolved of the obligation of informing the decree-holder by written notice even in respect of deposit in court either directly or by registered post. The purpose of addition of the expression, 'either through court directly or by registered post acknowledgment due' is that the judgment-debtor should not only give notice of payment but he must ensure that the decree holder has been served with the notice.

In our view, the decision of the Constitution Bench of the Supreme Court in Gurpreet Singh (supra) is of no avail to the appellants in the facts of this case. In this case, the Supreme Court was considering the aspect of the right of the decree holder to claim interest and to appropriate the amount deposited by the judgment debtor in pursuance of a Court decree, in different situations.

This is clear from a plain reading of the above extract. However, in the present case it cannot be said that the appellant had made the deposit in the executing Court since the deposit had been made in FAO(OS) 93/2002. 23. Therefore, we are of the view that the mere fact that the deposit of Rs. 58,80,380/- was made by the appellant in FAO(OS) 93/2002 as a condition for grant of stay for execution of the decree dated 2.8.2001 (which was eventually set aside on 20.4.2004), does not entitle the appellant to claim that interest in terms of the decree had stopped running from the date of deposit. No doubt, the interest earned on the deposit made in FAO (OS) 93/2002 would enure for the benefit of the appellant. We are also of the view that the appellant did not avail of the conditional remission of interest granted in the decree dated 15.7.2005 by making payment within six weeks, and the mere fact that the money was already lying deposited in FAO(OS) 93/2002 does not have the effect of payment of the decretal amount to the respondent decree holder. 24.

For ready reference facts are being taken from FAO No.94 of 2000. 2. The brief facts are that on 16th January, 1998 Surinder Pal, Mahesh Kumar, Jaswant Singh, Rajesh Kumar, Jarnail Singh and Mohinder Singh were travelling in Jeep bearing No.PB-03-D-9747 and met with an accident with a Punjab Police bus bearing No.PB-13-A-8590 and died."}, {"source": "Anita Rani v.

Five petitions were filed at Bathinda for claiming compensation from the State of Punjab and its employees for the death of Surinder Pal, Mahesh Kumar, Jaswant Singh, Rajesh Kumar and Mohinder Singh and one for damages which had been caused to the Jeep. The Tribunal held that negligence of the Punjab Police driver was not proved and dismissed the claim petitions. However, a sum of Rs.50,000/- was awarded to the claimants under no fault liability. The aforesaid appeals arise out of the dismissal of those claim petitions. 3. Petition for compensation for the death of Jarnail Singh was filed before the Tribunal at Sangrur. Before, the Tribunal at Sangrur, the award of Bathinda Tribunal was also placed on record. However, Tribunal at Sangrur held that there was contributory negligence of both the drivers. Against that award, the Insurance Company i.e. United India Insurance Company filed FAO No.5393 of 2002 and a Division Bench of this Court dismissed that appeal by order dated 20.02.2003. That order has become final. It is noteworthy that the State of Punjab or the Punjab police did not file any appeal against the finding of the Sangrur Tribunal holding the Punjab police driver guilty of contributory negligence. Against the compensation amount awarded, LRs of Jarnail Singh filed FAO No.4453 of 2003 (which is being decided by a separate order). 4.

Against the compensation amount awarded, LRs of Jarnail Singh filed FAO No.4453 of 2003 (which is being decided by a separate order). 4. There is one more supervening factor which needs to be addressed here in the claim petitions out of which FAO No.3562 of 1999 and FAO No.3563 of 1999 have arisen. The claimants did not implead the driver and owner of the jeep (supra). Learned counsel for the appellants have argued that it would be appropriate for this Court to implead the Insurance Company of the Jeep i.e. United India Insurance Company Limited and the owner in view of the fact that the finding on negligence has already been returned. Mr. Rohit Goswami, Advocate for Mr. D.P.Gupta, Advocate for United India Insurance Company Limited has, however, argued that once the Insurance Company and the owner were not parties before the Tribunal it would not be legal to implead them. The owner of the jeep has himself filed FAO No.3563 of 1999 for seeking claim for damages caused to his jeep (which is being decided separately). Since that appeal has been filed through Shri Ashok Jindal, Advocate who also filed FAO No.3562 of 1999, he is in no position to either oppose or support this prayer. 5. In my opinion even though the argument of Mr. Rohit Goswami, Advocate can not be brushed aside lightly yet it would lead to a very anomalous situation. These appeals have arisen out of an accident where five people have died. In one case where the owner of the jeep and its insurer were parties there is already a final and binding judgment upholding the order that the driver of the jeep was also guilty of contributory negligence and the Insurance Company is bound to compensate the claimants who were passengers in"}, {"source": "Anita Rani v.

In these circumstances it would be extremely unfair to insist on formal rules of impleadment, especially while effectuating a beneficial legislation. The Insurance company in question i.e. United India Insurance Company Limited is 'State' within the meaning of Article 12 of the Constitution of India and it would not lie in its mouth to take a plea that it can not be impleaded in an accident case where it has been already found liable to pay compensation to the identically situated LRs of another victim of the same accident. Consequently the argument of Mr.Rohit Goswami, Advocate is rejected. 6. In these circumstances I deem it appropriate to implead the owner-Raj Kumar through counsel Shri Ashok Jindal, Advocate as respondent No.4 in all the appeals except FAO No.3562 of 1999 in which he is impleaded as respondent No.7 and United India Insurance Company Limited through counsel Mr.Rohit Goswami, Advocate as respondents No.5 in all the appeals except FAO No.3562 of 1999 in which it is impleaded as respondent No.8.

Learned Additional Advocate General, however, argued that in the appeal filed by the Insurance Company no notice was issued to the State of Punjab. 9. In my opinion, this argument would not suffice; once it is shown that the finding of the Sangrur Tribunal holding that the driver of the Punjab police was guilty of contributory negligence was not challenged by the State, it can not now turn around and claim that there was no negligence on the part of their driver. Nothing stopped the State to file an appeal and thus it cannot now take a U-turn in the present cases and claim that the driver of the State was not guilty of any negligence. In the circumstances, the finding of the Tribunal at Bathinda is set aside and the finding of the Sangrur Tribunal as upheld by the Division Bench to the extent that both the drivers were guilty of contributory negligence would be made applicable to the present cases also. 10.

From the record, it also transpires that these are all burnt cases where the evidence has also been burnt. Learned counsel for the appellants state that they have copies of the entire evidence and pray that the matter be remitted back to the Tribunal at Motor Accident Claims Tribunal, Bathinda with permission to the claimants to reconstruct the record so that the Tribunal can compute the compensation in view of the finding of contributory negligence. I find it to be a fair submission and allow the appeals in the above terms. Parties through their counsel are directed to appear before Motor Accident Claims Tribunal at Bathinda on 18.07.2016. The Tribunal will grant one effective opportunity to each of the parties to reconstruct the record and thereafter compute the compensation which has to be awarded. 11. Before I part with this judgment there is one other issue which needs to be addressed. 18 long years (almost 2 decades) have passed since the death of the person/s for which the claimants have been clamoring for compensation. There are widows, minor children, old mothers and sisters. It is horrible to imagine how they must have passed this long time. Were they forced into beggary, or worse? Did the minors managed to get any education? Could the girls be married? Is what this Court now doing a travesty of justice? 12. In these stark circumstances I deem it appropriate to grant some interim compensation to the claimants. In FAO No.94 of 2000, the appellants-claimants are widow and two minor daughters of Rajesh Kumar. The respondents No.1 and 6 are directed to deposit Rs.3.00 lacs with the Motor Accident Claims Tribunal, Bathinda on or before the date"}, {"source": "Anita Rani v.

In this case I deem it appropriate to direct the respondents No.1 and 6 to deposit Rs.1 lakh as interim compensation on or before the date fixed there for immediate disbursal to the three appellants. Out of this amount of Rs.1 lakh, Rs.50,000/- be paid to appellant No.1-mother and Rs.25,000/- each to the appellants No.3 and 4 (unmarried sisters). In FAO No.3562 of 1999, I direct the respondents No.1 and 6 to deposit Rs.3 lakhs on or before the date fixed for immediate disbursal to the appellants No.1, 2 and 3 i.e. widow and children in equal shares on or before the date fixed for immediate disbursal to them. In FAO No.160 of 2001, I direct respondents No.3 and 5 to deposit a sum of Rs.3.5 lakhs on or before the date fixed for disbursal to the appellants No.1 to 5.

Since the driver of the jeep has also been held guilty of contributory negligence to the extent of 50% the compensation amount payable to these legal representatives and the owner of the jeep for damages having been caused to it would have to be halved and that half amount would be payable by the respondents including the State of Punjab. Therefore, I direct respondent No.3-State of Punjab to deposit Rs.3.5 lakhs on or before the date fixed for immediate disbursal to appellants No.1 to 5 (Rs.1 lakh to appellants No.1 and 4 each, Rs.50,000/- to appellants No.2, 3 and 5, sons and mother). 14. It is made clear that these amounts will be liable to be set off against the compensation finally computed by the Tribunal. It is further made clear that these amounts are just a rough and ready reckoning of interim relief because of the stark circumstances of the present cases and the Tribunal would decide the issue of compensation and apportionment independently. 15.

We must read into Section 17 the same provisions as contained in Sub-section (2) of Section 11 of the Act subject to such modifications as may be applicable to a State Commission.

The Bank guarantee was invoked at Saharanpur and payment was also made by the Saharanpur Branch of the Bank. Saharanpur Branch is situated within the State of U.P. No part of the cause of action has arisen m Delhi. It is difficult to agree with the view of the State Commission and also of the National Commission that the State Commission at Delhi had jurisdiction in the matter. 13.

Under Section 185 no consideration is necessary to create an agency. As far as Bhim Singh is concerned, there was no obligation cast on him to pay premium direct to LIC. Under the agreement between LIC and DESU, premium was payable to DESU who was to deduct every month from the salary of Bhim Singh and to transmit the same to LIC. DESU had, therefore, implied authority to collect premium from Bhim Singh on behalf of LIC. There was, thus, valid payment of premium by Bhim Singh. Authority of DESU to collect premium on behalf of LIC is implied. In any case, DESU had ostensible authority to collect premium from Bhim Singh on behalf of LIC.

Insurance agent is of LIC who appoints it and not of the employee in the present case. (Para 13) Held further : Formation of the contract of insurance is between LIC and the employee of DESU. Scheme has been introduced by the LIC purely on business considerations and not for any particular benefit of insurance conferred on the employee working in an organisation.

As far as employee is concerned he is told that premium will be deducted from his salary every month and remitted by DESU to LIC under an agreement between LIC and DESU.

Life Insurance Corporation (\u2018LIC for short), the insurer was, however, absolved of any liability. By the impugned judgment dated January 13,1995 by majority (2 : 1) National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission (\u2018National Commission\u2019 for short), on appeal, affirmed the order of the State Commission. DESU is the constituent of Delhi Municipal Corporation, a body corporate under the Delhi Municipal Corporation Act, 1957. Both the National Commission and the State Commission are constituted under the Consumer Protection Act, 1986. 2. LIC floated a \u201cSalary Savings Scheme\u201d under which Bhim Singh, an employee of DESU took an insurance policy for an amount of Rs. 50,000/- with the LIC. Insurance policy was to commence on January 28,1992. Bhim Singh had paid Rs. 636/- as premium for two months to the LIC. Premium for the third month was payable by March 29, 1992. The amount of the premium was deducted by the DESU from the salary of Bhim Singh and remitted by it to the LIC. It appears that premium for the subsequent months was deducted by DESU from the salary of Bhim Singh but was not remitted to LIC. In the meantime Bhim Singh died on August 17, 1992.

Bansati Devi, widow of Bhim Singh informed LIC of the death of her husband and requested for payment of the amount due under the policy. LIC disclaimed any liability for payment under the policy as the instalments of premium after June, 1992 were not received by it. LIC, therefore, repudiated claim of Basanti Devi. LIC said that since default had been committed in payment of premium the policy taken out by Bhim Singh lapsed. This led Basanti Devi to file a complaint before the State Commission against LIC and DESU with the result as aforesaid. 3.

BASANTI DEVI (SC) 19 course of arguments we were given a brochure on the Scheme. It is addressed to the employer telling it the advantages of the Scheme. This is how the Scheme has been explained : \u201cIt is a simple, economical plan whereby your employees may obtain life insurance protection for their families and retirement income for themselves under advantageous conditions which might not be available to them otherwise. This is accomplished by savings automati-cally deducted from their pay and remitted to us once a month. This is not a group insurance. Each employee owns his policy individually, is entitled to all its benefits and can continue the policy in the event of any change in employment. Under this plan, you as an employer give facilities to the representatives of the LIC to contact your employees to offer life insurance cover to them. Premium amounts, if an employee agrees to insure under this plan, are to be deducted every month from the employee\u2019s salary, in the same manner as the employee\u2019s provident fund. All the amounts so collected are paid to the Corporation by one cheque by the employer. This ensures, for the employee regular payment, monthly, of his premiums at concessional rates. Deduction of premium from the salary or wages of an employee and its remittance to the Life Insurance Corporation is so beneficial that the recently amended Payment of Wages Act and the Minimum Wages Act make it legally permissible for an employer to do so. On your part, all that the plan involves is a little extra accounting which you will surely consider worthwhile because of the...\u201d The scheme then lists the advantages both for the employer and the employee.

A specimen of the letter addressed by the Branch Manager, LIC to the employer is as under: \u201cDear Mr. Employer, The Salary Savings Scheme of Life Insurance Corporation has proved of considerable value to many organsiations and which we believe will be of keen interest to you and your employees. The general need on the part of the average employee for more adequate protection of his dependents is recognised as well as the desirability of his adequate provision for his own retirement. The Scheme is very simple. All that we need is the cooperation by your pay-roll department. They have to make the deduction of the premium on the employee policy holder\u2019s authorisation and remit them regularly to LIC alongwith a Reconciliation Statement. Your employee will, I am confident, appreciate the benefits of your Salary Savings Scheme. It will be a practical demonstration of your personal interest in the welfare of those who help to make your company successful. Moreover, it is in tune with the present social trend.

A reconciliation statement is also to be sent in the form prescribed by the LIC. No individual premium notice is to be sent by LIC to any employee and no receipt is to be given to him for the premium received. It is the DESU which is to inform LIC of all the changes in the staff as soon as they occur, so also the fact when any employee leaves the service of DESU. An employee is kept ignorant of the happenings between LIC and DESU except he is made aware of deduction of premium from his salary every month. 5. We have also been shown a circular titled \u201cSalary Savings Scheme Endorsement\u201d, which is as under : \u201cThis policy having been issued under the Corporation\u2019s Salary Savings Scheme, it is hereby declared that the instalment premium shall be payable at the rate shown in the schedule of the policy so long only as the Life Assured continues to be an employee of his present employer, whose name is stated in proposal and premiums are collected by the said employer out of the salary of the employee and remitted to the Corporation without any charge.

During the period in which premium is remitted to the Corporation through the employer, the instalment premium will be deemed to fall due on the 20th day on each month instead of the due date within mentioned.\u201d 6. The endorsement shows that the premium deducted by DESU from the salaries of the employees and remitted to LIC is without any charge. When the employee leaves the employment of the employer or his premium is ceased to be collected and/or remitted to the LIC this fact is to be intimated by the employee to the LIC. When the Scheme (Salary Savings Scheme) is withdrawn it is the LIC which intimates that fact to the employee whose life has been insured. Then premium is payable with an extra charge.

Considering the conditions as to how premium is to be deducted from the salaries of the employees and remitted to the LIC by the DESU by one cheque for all the employees with the reconciliation statement it is not possible for any employee to know if the amount of the premium deducted from his salary has been remitted or not. An employee is not being given any separate premium notice nor is he given any receipt for the premium received. If a condition is now placed on the employee that it is he who is to intimate the LIC if there is no remittance of the premium deducted by DESU it will be too onerous a condition to be of any validity. Considering the Scheme such a condition cannot be imposed on an employee. It is impracticable. A purposive interpretation has to be given to the endorsement and it has to be held that since payment of premium after deducting from the salary of the employees is between DESU and LIC, it will not be for the employee to intimate the LIC about non-remittance of the premium. 7.

The authority need not be an express authority; it may be implied from the circumstances.\u201d In this case premium was collected by the agent, who was not authorised to do so and did not deposit the same in turn with the LIC within the prescribed period. On August 9, 1987 the insured met with a fatal accident and he died the same day. On the following day, i.e. August 10,1987, the amount of the premium was deposited by the agent with the LIC. The claim was repudiated by the LIC on the ground that the policy had lapsed on account of non- payment of the premium. The matter having come in appeal from the order of the National Commission this Court upheld the contention of the LIC that the agent was not authorised to collect the premium on behalf of the LIC as the letter of his appointment as well as Regulation 8(4) of the Life Insurance Corporation of India (Agents) Regulations, 1972 expressly prohibited the agent from collecting the premium on behalf of the LIC.

When it was submitted that the LIC was liable on the basis of doctrine of apparent authority of the agent to collect premium and reliance was placed on Section 237 of the Contract Act this Court said that in the complaint that was filed no such case was set up that LIC, by its conduct, had induced the policy holders, including the insured, to believe that the agent was authorised to receive the premium on behalf of the LIC and further that there was no material on the record to support such a submission. In these circumstances this Court found itself unable to uphold the claim of the appellant, the complainant. 8. We where also referred to another decision of this Court in State of Orissa v. Divisional Manager, LIC & Anr., 1996 (8) SCC 655. Facts of the case have not been set out but what we can discern from the judgment is that a complaint was filed before the State Commission claiming damages against the LIC. State Commission awarded the damages and appeal was filed by the LIC before the National Commission where the National Commission directed that the State of Orissa be impleaded as a party respondent. National Commission thereafter awarded damages against the State of Orissa in the sum of rupees one lakh. This Court accepted the plea of the State of Orissa that it was not liable under the Act as it was not rendering any service for which it could be made liable. This Court referred to the definition of \u2018services\u2019 as contained in Section 2(l)(o) of the Act and held that it was not in dispute that the claimant was a Government servant and was bound by the service conditions and that the State was rendering him services", "page": 8}, {"source": "Delhi Electricity vs Basanti (SC).pdf", "chunk_id": 2, "text": "could be made liable.

The appeal of the State of Orissa was, therefore, allowed. 9. LIC is a body corporate constituted under the Life Insurance Corporation Act, 1956. It has framed regulations under Section 49 of the Act called the Life Insurance Corporation of India (Agents) Regulation, 1972. In view of the amendment by the Life Insurance Corporation (Amendment) Act, 1981 these Regulations are now known as Rules under the authority of the Central Government. Under Clause (b) of Regulation 3 \u2018agent\u2019 means a person who has been appointed under Regulation 4. Procedure for appointment and qualifications of the agents have been given in Regulations 4 and 5. Agent may be appointed for the purpose of soliciting or procuring life insurance business for the LIC. A person cannot be appointed as an agent unless he possesses a valid licence issued under Section 42 of the Insurance Act, 1938. Section 42 talks of licensing of insurance agent. Under this section the Controller or an officer authorised by him in that behalf is authorised to issue a licence to an 14/03/2007", "page": 8}, {"source": "Delhi Electricity vs Basanti (SC).pdf", "chunk_id": 3, "text": "an 14/03/2007", "page": 8}, {"source": "Delhi Electricity vs Basanti (SC).pdf", "chunk_id": 0, "text": "Vol. III DELHI ELECTRIC SUPPLY UNDERTAKING v.

We are not concerned here with the qualifications or disqualifications of an insurance agent or other provisions regulating his employment under the Insurance Act. LIC (Agents) Regulations prescribe the service conditions and functions of the insurance agents. Under Regulation 8 every agent shall solicit or procure new life insurance business which shall not be less than the minimum prescribed in the regulations and shall endeavour to conserve the business already secured. 10. In Harshad J. Shah\u2019s case this Court was concerned with an insurance agent appointed under Section 42 of the Insurance Act and his appointment under the Regulations for the purpose of soliciting or procuring life insurance business for the LIC and the Regulations and his conditions of service did not authorise him to collect premium on behalf of LIC. 11. In the present case we are not concerned with the insurance agent. It is not the case of the LIC that DESU could be permitted as an insurance agent within the meaning of the Insurance Act and the Regulations. DESU is not procuring or soliciting any business for the LIC. DESU is certainly not an insurance agent within the meaning of aforesaid Insurance Act and the Regulations but DESU is certainly an agent as defined in Section 182 of the Contract Act.

Agent in Section 182 means a person employed to do any act for another, or to represent other in dealings with third person and the person for whom such act is done, or who is so represented, is called the principal. Under Section 185 no consideration is necessary to create an agency. As far as Bhim Singh is concerned, there was no obligation cast on him to pay premium direct to LIC. Under the agreement between LIC and DESU, premium was payable to DESU who was to deduct every month from the salary of Bhim Singh and to transmit the same to LIC. DESU had, therefore, implied authority to collect premium from Bhim Singh on behalf of LIC. There was, thus, valid payment of premium by Bhim Singh. Authority of DESU to collect premium on behalf of LIC is implied. In any case, DESU had ostensible authority to collect premium from Bhim Singh on behalf of LIC. So far as Bhim Singh is concerned DESU was agent of LIC to collect premium on its behalf. 13.

When in para 7 of the letter addressed by the employer to the LIC it is mentioned that the employer shall act as agent of the employees and not agent of the LIC for any purpose, it is not referring to statutory agent being the insurance agent. Insurance agent is of LIC who appoints it and not of the employee in the present case. In the annexure to the letter from the LIC to the employer all responsibility is cast on the DESU to collect the premium from all the employees under the Scheme and to remit the same to LIC. Under the Scheme, there is no role of the insurance agent. He does not bring any business for the LIC. Scheme is introduced by the LIC itself. 14. We do not think decision of this Court in Harshad J. Shah & Anr. v. L.I.C. of India & Ors., (supra), has any application in the present case before us. Formation of the contract of insurance is between LIC and the employee of DESU. Scheme has been introduced by the LIC purely on business considerations and not for any particular benefit of insurance conferred on the employee working in an organisation. Though in the proforma letter written by DESU 14/03/2007", "page": 9}, {"source": "Delhi Electricity vs Basanti (SC).pdf", "chunk_id": 3, "text": "written by DESU 14/03/2007", "page": 9}, {"source": "Delhi Electricity vs Basanti (SC).pdf", "chunk_id": 0, "text": "24 (SC) CONSUMER PROTECTION JUDGMENTS 1999 to LIC it is mentioned that DESU would be an agent of its employee and not that of the LIC but this understanding between the LIC and DESU was not communicated or made known to the employee. As far as employee is concerned he is told that premium will be deducted from his salary every month and remitted by DESU to LIC under an agreement between LIC and DESU. For employee of DESU, therefore, DESU had implied authority as an agent of LIC to collect premium on its behalf and then pay to LIC. There is nothing on the record to show that Bhim Singh was ever made aware of the fact that DESU was not acting as agent of LIC. Rather in the nature of the Scheme, the employee was made to believe that it is the duty of the employer though gratuitously cast on him by the LIC to collect premium by deducting from the salary of each employee covered under the Scheme every month and to remit the same to LIC by means of one consolidated cheque. Now it could be said that DESU would not be liable as an agent of its principal, i.e. LIC and also it was rendering service of collecting the premium and remitting the same to LIC free of any cost to employee. As to what is the arrangement between the LIC and DESU employee is not concerned. In these circumstances DESU cannot perhaps be held liable under the Act. But then the question arises if the widow of Bhim Singh can be left high and dry in this legal rig-marole when it is clear that as far as Bhim Singh was concerned he did pay the premium and it was the fault of the agent", "page": 10}, {"source": "Delhi Electricity vs Basanti (SC).pdf", "chunk_id": 1, "text": "liable under the Act.

In these circumstances LIC was wrongly discharged of its liability under the insurance policy taken out by Bhim Singh. Now LIC is not aggrieved of the orders passed by the State Commission and the National Commission and when DESU had been held liable to pay an amount equivalent to the insurance policy of Bhim Singh, Basanti Devi also felt satisfied and did not pursue its remedy against LIC. All the three, i.e. DESU, LIC and Basanti Devi are before us and we have heard learned Counsel for the LIC as to why LIC was not liable under the policy of insurance. Proceedings have arisen under the Act, which was enacted to provide protection to the interests of the consumers and under Section 3 provisions of the Act shall be in addition to and not in derogation of the provisions of any other law for the time being in force. In these circumstances we do not think we should deprive Basanti Devi of her right, which admittedly she has, holding on the one hand DESU is not liable and on the other hand her not challenging the order of the State Commission discharging LIC. 15.

In Supreme Court Bar Association v. Union of India, 1998 (4) SCC 409=IV (1998) SLT 573=II (1998) CLT 53 (SC), this Court was considering the scope of Article 142. The question before it was whether the Supreme Court can, while dealing with contempt proceedings, exercise power under Article 129 of the Constitution or under Article 129 read with Article 142 of the Constitution or under Article 142 of the Constitution to debar a practising Lawyer from carrying on his profession as Lawyer for any period whatsoever. This Court explained its powers under Article 142 as under : (para 47) \u201cThe plenary powers of this Court under Article 142 of the Constitution are inherent in the Court and are complementary to those powers which are specifically conferred on the Court by various statutes though are not limited by those statutes. These powers also exist independent of the statutes with a view to do complete justice between the parties. These powers are of very wide amplitude and are in the nature of supplementary powers. This power exists as a separate and independent basis of jurisdiction apart from the statues. It stands upon the foundation and the basis for its exercise may be put on a different and perhaps even wider footing, to prevent injustice in the process of litigation and to do complete justice between the parties.

BASANTI DEVI (SC) 25 is just and equitable to do so and in particular to ensure the observance of the due process of law, to do complete justice between the parties, while administering justice according to law. There is no doubt that it is an indispensable adjunct to all other powers and is free from the restraint of jurisdiction and operates as a valuable weapon in the hands of the Court to prevent \u201cclogging or obstruction of the stream of justice\u201d. It, however, needs to be remembered that the powers conferred on the Court by Article 142 being curative in nature cannot be construed as powers which authorise the Court to ignore the substantive rights of a litigant while dealing with a cause pending before it. This power cannot be used to \u201csupplant\u201d substantive law applicable to the case or cause under consideration of the Court. Article 142, even with the width of its amplitude, cannot be used to build a new edifice where none existed earlier, by ignoring express statutory provisions dealing with a subject and thereby to achieve something indirectly which cannot be achieved directly.

This provision was explained by this Court in Mahant Dhangir & Anr. v. Madan Mohan & Ors., 1987 Supp. SCC 528, in the following words : \u201cThe sweep of the power under Rule 33 is wide enough to determine any question not only between the appellant and respondent, but also between respondent and co-respondents. The Appellate Court could pass any decree or order which ought to have been passed in the circumstances of the case. The Appellate Court could also pass such other decree or order as the case may require. The words \u201cas the case may require\u201d used in Rule 33 of Order 41 have been put in wide terms to enable the Appellate Court to pass any order or decree to meet the ends of justice. What then should be the constraint ? We do not find many. We are not giving any liberal interpretation.

The only constraint that we could see, may be these: That the parties before the lower Court should be there before the Appellate Court. The question raised must properly arise out of the judgment of the lower Court. If these two requirement are there, the Appellate Court could consider any objection against any part of the judgment or decree of the lower Court. It may be urged by any party to the appeal. It is true that the power of the Appellate Court under Rule 33 is discretionary. But it is a proper exercise of judicial discretion to determine all questions urged in order to render complete justice between the parties. The Court should not refuse to exercise that discretion on mere technicalities.\u201d 19. Conditions as laid in provision of Order 41, Rule 33 are satisfied in the present case. When circumstances exist which necessitate the exercise of discretion conferred by Rule 33, the Court cannot be found wanting when it comes to exercise its powers. 20. We, therefore, direct that LIC shall pay to Basanti Devi insurance amount of Rs. 50,000/- with interest at the rate of 15% per annum from December 17,1992 till payment, thus substituting Life Insurance Corporation of India for Delhi Electric Supply Undertaking, as ordered by the State Commission and upheld by the National Commission. 21. For suffering which Basanti Devi had to undergo for the default committed by DESU in not remitting the premium to LIC we would direct that DESU will pay cost of these proceedings, which we quantify at Rs. 25,000/-.

It was the case of Kesar Bai that a partition was effected on 12.03.1964 amongst Vishal; Ramnath, Phannuram\u2019s nephew; and Manbat Bai, Phannuram\u2019s sister-in-law. Having received Phannuram\u2019s 1/3rd share in the coparcenary properties, Vishal rejected Kesar Bai\u2019s demand for partition and allotment of her individual share therein. Kesar Bai thereupon instituted a partition suit, which came to be numbered as Civil Suit No. 146A of 1991 on the file of the learned First Civil Judge, Division-II, Raipur. Therein, she claimed her share in the coparcenary properties along with mesne profits. During the pendency of the suit, Kesar Bai died on 17.06.1988 and her son, Derha Ram, the present appellant, succeeded to her estate under registered will dated 16.12.1980. 4. Upon considering the issues settled for trial and on the strength of the evidence, oral and documentary, the Trial Court decreed the suit on 06.11.1996, holding that Derha was entitled to 1/3rd share in the suit scheduled agricultural land and a 1/3rd share in two house properties. The Trial Court also held him entitled to mesne profits @ .400 per annum from \u20b9 1979 till separate possession was delivered to him. 5.

The matter was then carried in appeal by Vishal and Keja Bai to the High Court of Chhattisgarh in Second Appeal No. 891 of 1999. By judgment dated 31.03.2009, the High Court partly allowed the second appeal and held that Derha would be entitled to 1/6th share in the suit properties, i.e., the agricultural land and two dwelling houses. Aggrieved by the reduction of his share, Derha filed the present appeal by special leave. 7. By Order dated 09.10.2009, this Court directed status quo obtaining as on that date to be maintained by both parties. 8. A feeble attempt was made by the learned counsel for the appellant to contend that the suit properties were not coparcenary properties but were joint properties held by Phannuram and his brothers. However, this argument cannot be countenanced as the original plaintiff, Kesar Bai, had approached the Trial Court contending that the suit properties were ancestral properties. Her son and heir cannot be permitted to take a different stand now, contrary to her pleadings. Further, the argument that Manbat Bai, Phannuram\u2019s sister-in-law, would not have been allotted a share in the partition on 12.03.1964 had the properties been coparcenary properties, needs mention only to be rejected. The said partition was never subjected to challenge and without details as to when Manbat Bai\u2019s husband died, this Court cannot venture an opinion on whether allotment of a share to her in that partition was lawful.

More so, as Kesar Bai herself filed a suit claiming that the properties in which she wanted a share were ancestral properties. 9. Once it is held that the properties which were the subject matter of the partition suit were coparcenary properties, the only issue that remains is as to how the said properties were to be divided amongst the legal heirs of Phannuram upon his death in 1959, i.e., after the advent of the Hindu Succession Act, 1956 (for brevity, \u2018the Act of 1956\u2019). Section 6 of the Act of 1956 would govern the situation, as rightly observed by the Chhattisgarh High Court. Section 6 of the Act of 1956, as it then stood, states that when a male Hindu died after the commencement of the Act of 1956, having at the time of his death an interest in Mitakshara coparcenary property, his interest in that property shall devolve by survivorship upon the surviving members of the coparcenary. However, the proviso thereto states that, if the deceased left behind him a surviving female relative specified in Class I of the Schedule or a male relative specified in that class who claimed through such female relative, the interest of the deceased in the Mitakshara coparcenary property shall devolve by testamentary or intestate succession, as the case may be, under the Act of 1956 and not by survivorship. Explanation 1 clarified that, for the purposes of Section 6, the interest of a Hindu Mitakshara coparcener shall be deemed to be the share in the property that would have been allotted to him if a partition of the property had taken place immediately before his death, irrespective of whether he was entitled to claim such partition or not. 4", "page": 4}, {"source": "Derha Vs Vishal(SC HUF Dividation).pdf", "chunk_id": 1, "text": "be the share in the property that would have been allotted to him if a partition of the property had taken place immediately before his death, irrespective of whether he was entitled to claim such partition or not. 4", "page": 4}, {"source": "Derha Vs Vishal(SC HUF Dividation).pdf", "chunk_id": 0, "text": "10. Section 8 of the Act of 1956 elaborates on intestate succession in the case of males. It provides that a property of a male Hindu, dying intestate, shall devolve firstly, upon Class I heirs; secondly, upon Class II heirs; thirdly, if there is no heir of any of the two Classes, upon the agnates of the deceased; and lastly, if there is no agnate, then upon the cognates of the deceased. 11. In Gurupad Khandappa Magdum vs. Hirabai Khandappa Magdum and others [(1978) 3 SCC 383], a 3-Judge Bench of this Court dealt with Section 6 of the Act of 1956 in depth. It was held therein that, in order to ascertain the shares of the heirs in the property of a deceased coparcener, the first step is to ascertain the share of the deceased himself in the coparcenary property and Explanation 1 to Section 6 provides a fictional expedient, namely, that his share is deemed to be the share in the property that would have been allotted to him if a partition had taken place immediately before his death. It was pointed out that once that assumption has been made for the purpose of ascertaining the share of the deceased, one cannot go back on the assumption and ascertain the shares of the heirs without reference to it, and all the consequences which flow from a real partition have to be logically worked out, which means that the shares of the heirs must be ascertained on the basis that they had separated from one another and had received a share in the partition which had taken place during the life-time of the deceased.

This principle finds affirmation in Shyama Devi (Smt) and others vs. Manju Shukla (Mrs) and another [(1994) 6 SCC 342] and several other decisions of this Court and various High Courts across the country. 13. Applying this principle, the share of Phannuram would first have to be determined as on the date of his death. He seems to have had two brothers and would have been entitled to a 1/3rd share in the coparcenary properties, if a partition had been effected before his death. In fact, such a partition was actually effected in 1964 and Phannuram\u2019s 1/3rd share was allotted to his only son, Vishal. However, Vishal was a coparcener in his own right in a separate coparcenary with his father and would be entitled to a share in that coparcenary property by birth. Therefore, he would be entitled to a half-share by birth in the I/3rd share of the coparcenary properties that was allotted as Phannuram\u2019s share. The other half-share therein belonged to Phannuram and as he died intestate, it would firstly devolve upon his Class I heirs, in terms of Section 8 of the Act of 1956. His Class 1 heirs, as on the date of his death, were Kesar Bai, Vishal and Keja Bai, his three children. His half-share would therefore be divided equally amongst the three of them, i.e., 1/6th each. In consequence, the final division of the 1/3rd share of Phannuram in the coparcenary properties would be as follows: Vishal would be entitled to 6", "page": 6}, {"source": "Derha Vs Vishal(SC HUF Dividation).pdf", "chunk_id": 1, "text": "equally amongst the three of them, i.e., 1/6th each.

The deceased was being paid Rs.4,500/- per month by way of his avocation. The Tractor & Trailer was being used to carry gravel from hillock situated in Ramapuram Village to the surrounding work spot where gravel was required. The practice was that the driver of the O.P.No.1/owner used to collect coolies from Challavaripalli and Ramapuram Villages etc. and used to go to hillock for chipping the gravel and loading it on the Tractor and Trailer for unloading the same at the required spot. 4. While so, on 24.08.2004, the deceased along with other co- workers boarded the Trailer and while the vehicle was proceeding towards hillock there was a sudden jerk in the movement of the vehicle, the deceased fell down and the wheel of the Trailer ran over him causing grievous injuries.

O.P.No.2-Insurance Company filed its counter denying the claim by disputing the manner of occurrence of accident, wages, the age of the deceased and the jural relationship between the deceased and O.P.No.1/owner as well as the license of the driver of the tractor. It was also pleaded that the deceased was working as a stone cutter but not as a Hamali and that the deceased was negligently standing in between the tractor and trailer connecting with the iron rod, the deceased fell under the Trailer on account of jerking, which resulted in the death.

Having heard the respective contentions, this Court opines as under:- Regarding the first ground that no premium was paid to cover the deceased, it is to be noted that deceased was travelling as a workman and is not a gratuitous passenger. The Section 145 (i) of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988 was amended vide the Motor Vehicles (Amendment) Act, 2019 elaborating the term \u2018third party\u2019. As per the amended definition, \u2018third party\u2019 includes any co-worker on transport vehicle other than the owner and the driver. The amended Section 145 (1) reads as under: 145 (i) \u201cthird party\u201d includes the Government, the driver and any other co-worker on a transport vehicle. 18. This Court in National Insurance Co. Ltd. v. Savidi Anjaneyulu1 has held that the amendment to the definition of Section 145 (i) of the Motor Vehicles (Amendment) Act, 2019 is only clarificatory and therefore it is applicable retrospectively covering the risk of the driver or any other co-worker on transport vehicle as third- party. 1 SCC OnLine AP 4840", "page": 7}, {"source": "DM Vs B Gangamma (Himali worker is third 3rd Party).pdf", "chunk_id": 0, "text": "8 19. In the instant case, the deceased being a Hamali cannot be said to be a gratuitous passenger and comes within the amended definition of \u2018third party\u2019 under section 145(i) of the Motor Vehicles (Amendment) Act, 2019 as it stands today and would be covered by Ex.B.2 Policy. 20. The second contention of the counsel for the Appellant- Insurance Company is that the vehicle was used for non-agricultural purpose and liability should not be imposed on the insurance company. As rightly contended by the counsel for the Respondents, O.P.No.1/owner had clearly deposed in Paragraph 2 of his chief examination affidavit that the vehicle on that particular day was being used to bring stones from the hillock for the purpose of fencing of his land to prevent cattle etc. from entering into his land. O.P.No.2- Insurance Company did not cross examine O.P.No.1/owner on this aspect in their cross examination. 21. In the absence of any cross examination on this aspect, by the Insurance Company, the same would amount to admission by the insurance company regarding the purpose of usage of the vehicle on that particular day. The requirement of stones around the agricultural land of O.P.No.1 being allied to the agricultural purpose, it is not open to the insurance company to contend otherwise. 22. This Court does not find any merit in the submission of the counsel for the Appellant-Insurance Company. Therefore, this Court does not find any substantial question of law for interference. Accordingly, the C.M.A. is dismissed.

Initially, the suit was decreed by the trial Court on 13.11.1978. However, in appeal, the judgment and decree dated 13.11.1978 was set aside and the case was remanded to the learned trial Court with the direction to implead Punjab Wakf Board as a defendant. Punjab Wakf Board was impleaded as a defendant in view of the pleadings of the other defendants that they are lessees of the Punjab Wakf Board. The learned trial Court framed additional issue No. 6-A to the effect whether the suit property was the ownership of the Wakf Board. The trial Court decreed the suit deciding issues No. 1, 6 and 6-A in favour of the plaintiffs. However, in appeal, the appellate Court reversed the judgment and decree passed by the trial Court. 3. The Courts below have found that Khasra No. 134 is Gair Mumkin Taur. In the Khasra Girdawari, plaintiff Dev Raj is recorded in possession of Khasra No. 134. Khasra No. 133 is recorded as Gair Mumkin Masjid in the revenue record. However, Khasra No. 134, the property in dispute, is recorded as owned by the Central Government in the revenue record. Such entries in the revenue record are rebutable. The first appellate Court has found that Khasra No. 134 has been notified as a Wakf Board property in the gazette Exhibit D-1, which property has been leased by the Wakf Board to other defendants.

Teja Singh etc. defendants are alleged to have been delivered possession vide report Exhibit D-10 dated 13.04.1974. The receipts of payment of rent are Exhibits D-2 to D-8 issued by the officers of the Wakf Board. Therefore, the defendants are in possession and consequently dismissed the suit. It was held that the plaintiffs have not been able to prove its possession over the said taur and since construction has been raised by the plaintiffs during the pendency of the suit, the plaintiffs were given 6 months time to remove such construction. 4. Learned counsel for the plaintiff-appellants has relied upon the decision in the case of Punjab Wakf Board v. Kartar Singh, 1987 P.L.J. 95 to contend that the notification declaring the property as vesting in the Wakf Board is not conclusive regarding the rights of third person. For returning such findings, reliance was placed on the decision of the Supreme Court in the case of Board of Muslim Wakf, Rajasthan v. Radha Kishan and others, AIR 1979 Supreme Court 289 and earlier judgment of this Court reported as Punjab Wakf Board v. Commissioner, Patiala Division and others, 1973 Revenue Law Reporter 467. 5. The following substantial questions of law arise for consideration :- \"1. Whether finding regarding ownership of Khasra No. 134 can be recorded in the absence of Custodian/Central Government ? 2. Whether the notification to the effect that Khasra No. 134 vests with Wakf Board is conclusive and binding on the plaintiffs ?\" 6.

The learned first appellate Court has found that Khasra No. 134 though records the ownership of the Custodian but such entries in the revenue record stood rebutted. Such findings have been recorded even though the Central Government/Custodian is not a party to the suit. Therefore, the finding regarding ownership cannot be binding to the Central Government/Custodian. 7. The dispute is regarding ownership of Khasra No. 134 which the defendants are claiming to have vested in the Punjab Wakf Board by virtue of a notification. There is no evidence on behalf of the defendants that there was any dedication so as to vest such property in the Wakf Board. The first appellate Court had found that it is very difficult for the Wakf Board to produce evidence of original dedication of this property Page 2 of 3 Law Finder DocId # 71803 Licensed to: Sh.Naresh Garg,Advocate Bathinda Punjab 02-10-2022 Law Finder", "page": 2}, {"source": "Dev Vs Teja (Waqf).pdf", "chunk_id": 0, "text": "by a person professing Islam faith for a religious and charitable purpose. The said finding of vesting of property in the Wakf Board merely on the basis of the notification Exhibit D-1 is contrary to law as mentioned above and cannot be sustained when there is no evidence of dedication in favour of the Wakf Board. Consequently, finding of the first appellate Court on Issue No. 6-A is set aside. Thus, in respect of question No. 2, it is held that the notification is not conclusive proof of ownership of Wakf Board. 8. The plaintiffs have produced on record Khasra Girdawari in support of their assertion of possession. During the pendency of the present appeal, an application has been filed by the plaintiff-respondents alleging therein that they had purchased the property from the Custodian. The revenue record produced reflects the possession of the plaintiffs since Rabi 1974. There is no issue regarding ownership of the plaintiffs in respect of the suit property. The Wakf Board is not proved to be the owner of the land. Therefore, it is open to the parties to agitate and raise the issue of title in a properly constituted suit before a competent court of law. 9. The first appellate Court had directed the plaintiffs to remove the superstructure from the plot in dispute, though allegedly raised during the pendency of the suit, meaning thereby that it is the plaintiffs who are now in possession of the suit property.

The opposite party investigated the matter and received information on 26.9.2014 that the DLA had applied for issue health cover insurance policy from FirstLife Insurance Compay Limited in December, 2011, which was declined due to elevated blood sugar level on 23.2.2012.

Repudiation letter dated 20.2.2015 noticed Questions-11-Insurability Declaration, 12- Insurance History and 14-Medical History and found that (i) the DLA was suffering from Diabetes, Mellitus and Hypertension much prior to obtaining present policy; (ii) the DLA applied to Birla Sun Life Insurance Compay Limited and various other Insurance Companies,which were not disclosed; (iii) the DLA was declined issue of policy due to adverse medical reports; and (iv) the date of birth of the DLA in his PAN card was mentioned as 14.10.1960, while in his Birth Certificate issued by Sangali Miraj and Kupwad City Corporation, it was 14.10.1961. On the basis these findings, it was held that as the DLA had concealed material information as such the policy was void and the claim was repudiated. 7. The DLA died in Ratnam Hospital, Rajkot on 26.4.2014 at 11:00 hours. Ratnam Hospital did not mention cause of death in Death Certificate (filed on page 45 of the complaint) nor any diagnosis or test report at Ratnam Hospital shows that the DLA was suffering from diabetes or heart diseases. In Post Mortem report dated 26.04.2014 (page-115 of the complaint), cause of death of the DLA could not be ascertained and viscera was preserved. In Government Regional Forensic Science Laboratory Report dated 16.8.2014 (page-91 of the complaint), no chemical poison was found.

It was mentioned in this certificate that the relative had no provided any documents of previous treatment. If the DLAhad not taken any medicine of diabetes and heart diseases, then from where the relative will provide documents in this respect. The opposite party adduced evidence of Dr. C.H. Asrani (medical expert) and Sanjay Bhatt (the investigator) to prove that the DLA was suffering from diabetes and heart related diseases before obtaining the policy in question. Sanjay Bhatt (the investigator) made hectic efforts to prove that the police records and post mortem report of theDLA are fabricated documents but the fact that the DLA died on 26.4.2014 at Ratnam Hospital could not be falsified. If Ratnam Hospital informed the local police about suspicious death of the DLA, then the police was duty bound to make Inquest, send the dead body for post mortem.In the absence of any other document, relating to post mortem of the body of the DLA, we see no reason to disbelieve the Post Mortem Report and Viscera Examination Report as produced by the complainant. In repudiation letter, Investigator\u2019s report dated 12.2.2015 was not reliedupon. Even for the sake of argument, it is taken that the DLA died due to heart attack on 26.4.2014, then also it could not be presumed that the DLA was suffering from diabetes and heart diseases in December, 2012 at the time of obtaining present policy. 8.

The opposite party stated that the DLA had applied for issue of \u201cMoney Back Health Plan\u201d insurance policy to IndiaFirst Life Insurance Compay Limited on 30.12.2011, on which,medical tests of the DLA were conducted in February, 2012 and due to adverse medical reports,his form was rejected.

In view of the above discussions we found that the opposite party had failed to prove that the DLA was suffering from diabetes and heart related diseases prior to obtaining policy in question and had knowingly withheld information in this respect in the proposal form. 10.

In the proposal form, he had mentioned his date of birth as 14.10.1960 as mentioned in his PAN card.It could not be considered as deliberate concealment of any material fact. By giving a longerage, he was subjected to higher premium and no prejudice has been caused to the Insurer. On its basis claim could not be repudiated. 11. Earlier the phrase \u2018material fact\u2019 was not defined in the statute. Supreme Court in United India Insurance Compay Limited v. M.K.J.

Any fact which goes to the root of thecontract of insurance and has a bearing on the risk involved, would be \u201cmaterial\u201d. Thisproposition has been followed in Modern Insulator Limited v. Oriental Insurance Company Limited, I (2000) CPJ 1 (SC)=II (2000) SLT 323=(2000) 2 SCC 734.

Supreme Court in Santwant Kaur Sandhu v. New India Assurance Company Limited, IV (2009) CPJ 8 (SC)=VI (2009) SLT 338=(2009) 8 SCC 316, held that if the proposer had knowledge of such fact, he is obliged to disclose it, particularly while answering questions in the proposal form. Needless to emphasise that any in accurate answer will entitled the insurer to repudiate his liability because there is clear presumption that any information sought for in proposal form is material for the purpose of entering into a contract of insurance.In Reliance Life Insurance Compay Limited v. Rekhaben Nareshbhai Rathod, II (2019) CPJ 53 (SC)=IV (2019) SLT 235=(2019) 6S CC 175, it has been held that materiality of the fact also depends upon the surroundingcircumstances and the nature of information sought by the Insurer. It covers a failure to disclose vital information which the Insurer requires in order to determine firstly whether or not to assume the risk of insurance and secondly, if it does accept the risk, upon what term it should do. Which has been followed in Branch Manager, Bajaj Allianz Life Insurance CompayLimited v. Dalbir Kaur, IV (2020) CPJ 60 (SC)=(2021) 13 SCC 553. 12. The opposite party has filed proposal form (on page-163 of the reply), on which, present policy was issued.

Information relating to insurance history was question No. 12, which cannot be said to be material for underwriting the risk to be covered by the Insurer. Similarly, date of birth was relevant for charging premium and on the basis of the date of birth as 14.10.2960, higher premium has been charged as such no prejudiced has been caused to the opposite party. In view of aforesaid discussion, we find that repudiation letter dated 20.2.2015 is illegal and liable to be set aside. 13. Another question arises that from which date the interest is payable on the insurance claim. The Supreme Court in Secretary, Irrigation Department, Government of Orissa v. G.C. Roy, 1991 (SLT SOFT) 231=(1992) 1 SCC 508, held that the interest is a compensation for deprivation of use ofthe money to its legitimate owner. Regulation 9 of Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority (Protection of Policyholders\u2019 Interest) Regulations, 2017 provides for completion of survey within three months and thereafter the insurer is required to take decision within one month. Therefore, at the most from the date of communication of loss, the settlement has to be done within six months. If it is not done within six months, then the claimant is entitled for interest after six months. ORDER In view of the aforesaid discussion, the complaint is allowed.

ORDER Bhai Sardar Singh and Sons, the respondent before us, was awarded a contract for construction of 1068 houses at Motia Khan by the Delhi Development Authority ('DDA' for short), the appellant before us. During its execution, disputes arose with the respondent invoking the arbitration clause way back in 1982. After about sixteen years, award dated 12th August 1998 was published requiring the appellant to pay to the respondent a sum of Rs.18,89,998/- along with interest at 18% per annum on Rs.14,40,386/-, being the principal sum, with effect from 13th March 1986, till the date of payment. 2.

Arguments on the objections were heard by the learned single judge on 8th December 2004. By judgment dated 15th July 2005 the objections to the award under Section 30/33 of the Arbitration Act, 1940 were dismissed primarily on the ground that the court was not empowered or inclined to interfere with the findings of fact which had been recorded by the arbitrator, who was a retired Chief Engineer of the Central Public Works Department (CPWD). However, on the question of interest, the learned single judge referred to the award of interest at 18% per annum, which it was pleaded was very high and unreasonable, to record that the counsel for the respondent was 'prepared to confine his interest claim to a figure found reasonable by this court, provided the objection was not argued on merits by the appellant'.

In so far as the award of interest @ 18% on the awarded amount of Rs. 14,40,386/- with effect from 13th March, 1986 to the date of decree or payment whichever is earlier is concerned, considering the fact that a considerable period has elapsed between the award delivered on 12th August, 1998 and the high amount of interest which may be available to the petitioner/claimant subject to the dismissal of objections to the award, the interest awarded by the arbitrator at 18% per annum deserves to be reduced. I have also noticed the present drop in the market rate of interest. The learned counsel for the petitioner has filed a statement of interest payable on the amount awarded by the arbitrator, the calculations of which have not been disputed by the respondent/DDA. A perusal of the said table shows that the interest at the rate of 18% per annum would be unreasonable. I am of the view that the interest should be awarded at 9% per annum with effect from 13th March, 1986 to the date of decree or payment, whichever is earlier. The reduced amount of interest would be available to the DDA if the payment as per the award and the modified rates of interest is made within six weeks from the date of this judgment failing which the interest shall revert back to the rate of 18% per annum as awarded by the arbitrator. 4. As the objections were dismissed, the High Court directed that the award was made the rule of the court. While doing so, the court had further directed drawing up decree sheet in the following terms: \"The award dated 12th August, 1998 is made a rule of the Court.

A reading of the aforesaid paragraphs in the judgment would show the contradictions. The learned single judge had noticed that there was a drop in the market rate of interest to observe that interest at 18% per annum would be unreasonable. Therefore, the learned single judge was of the view that interest should be awarded at 9% per annum with effect from 13th March 1986 till the date of decree or payment, whichever is earlier. However, it was observed that this reduced rate of interest would be applicable if payment as per the award and modified rate of interest was made within six weeks from the date of judgment, failing which the interest would be at 18% per annum, as awarded by the arbitrator. The contradiction is apparent as the learned single judge failed to notice that the appellant had already deposited Rs. 58,80,386/-, as recorded in the order dated 20th May 2002. Apparently, neither the appellant nor the respondent had also brought this fact to the notice of the Court. It may be relevant to state that the appellant had not withdrawn this deposit which was made pursuant to the interim order passed by the Division Bench in FAO (OS) No. 93 of 2002, even after this appeal was allowed.

Payment in the form of deposit of Rs. 58,80,380/- had already been made, as noted above. The date of decree would be obviously the date on which the judgment was passed by the learned single judge making the award a rule of the Court, that is, 15th July 2005.

Neither party asked for correction of this judgment. 6. It transpires that the respondent, on or about 28th September 2005, filed an execution petition EP No. 168 of 2015 ('first execution petition' for short) for a sum of Rs.18,89,998/- and interest at 18% per annum on Rs.14,40,386/- with effect from 13th March 1986.

The execution petition did not mention that the appellants had deposited Rs.58,80,380/- and the amount be released and paid. 7. During the pendency of the execution petition, on 14th December 2005, statement was made by the counsel appearing for the appellant that the money was already lying deposited in the court and the appellant had no objection if the respondent moves for withdrawal of the said amount. This order records that the counsel for the respondent had stated that the amount, if any, deposited by the appellant was short of the money awarded under the \"terms of the contract\". The execution petition was disposed of recording that the respondent would withdraw the amount first after seeking orders of the court of competent jurisdiction. In the event of money being short, liberty was granted to the respondent to file execution petition for the remaining amount. 8. Thereafter, it appears the respondent had filed an application for withdrawal of the amount lying deposited with the Registrar General of the High Court, which application was allowed vide order dated 27th April 2006. The order also records that the appellant had no objection for payment of the deposited amount.

Sub-rule 1 to Rule 1 of Order XXI of the Code prescribes three modes for paying money under a decree, namely: (a) by deposit of money in the court which is to execute the decree, which deposit can be through postal money order or through bank; (b) by making payment to the decree holder by postal money order or through bank or any other mode wherein payment is evidenced in writing; or (c) as the court which made the decree directs. Sub-rule 3 prescribes the details which have to be furnished by the judgment debtor where money is paid by postal money order or through bank under clauses (a) or (b). Sub-rule 3 also permits the judgment-debtor to stipulate apportionment or adjustment where amount is payable to more than one person or towards the principal sum or interest or cost. Sub-rule 2, which applies to payment made under clauses (a) or (c) sub-rule 1, requires the judgment debtor to give notice to the decree holder either through the court or directly to the decree holder by registered post, acknowledgement due. Sub-rule 4 states that where an amount is paid under clause (a) or (c) of sub-rule 1, interest, if any, shall cease to run from the date of service of notice referred to in sub-rule 2.

As per sub-rule 5, where amount is paid under clause (b) of sub-rule 1, interest, if any, ceases to run from the date of such payment. We need not refer to the proviso as it is not applicable to the facts of the present case. 14. A reading of the aforesaid sub-rules clarifies that when money is paid under a decree, the interest, if any, shall cease to run either from the date of direct payment or from the date of service of notice to the decree holder, wherever applicable. Sub-rules 4 and 5 do not stipulate that the interest would stop running only and only when the entire amount as per the decree shall stand paid. This Court, as will be seen below, has held that money even when paid in part towards the decree would cease to accrue interest to the extent of the amount paid. 15. The Constitution Bench of this Court in Gurpreet Singh (supra) had examined the 'stage-wise' appropriation rule as expounded in Prem Nath Kapur and Another v. National Fertilizers Corporation of India and Others (1996) 2 SCC 71 and had, after referring to the provisions of Order XXI Rule 1 and Order XXIV of the Code, observed that the former applies to post-decretal stage and the latter applies to pre-decretal stage. In the context of Rule 1 of Order XXI it was observed as under: \"15. Order 21, Rule 1 provides the modes of paying money under a decree. It stipulates that all monies payable under a decree shall be paid: (a) by deposit into the court whose duty it is to execute the decree, or (b) out of court, to the decree-holder in the manner provided, or (c) otherwise, as the court which made the decree directs.

Sub-rule (2) provides that where a payment is made by deposit into the court or as directed in the decree, the judgment-debtor shall give notice thereof to the decree-holder either through the court or directly to him by registered post acknowledgement due. On any amount paid by way of deposit into the court or as directed under the decree, interest, if any, shall cease to run from the date of the service of the notice referred to in sub-rule (2). Thus, Order 21, Rule 1 after its amendment in the year 1976 also contemplates the deposit of the decree amount into court and the giving of notice thereof to the decree-holder and provides further for cessation of interest from the date of notice to the decree-holder of such deposit.\" Referring to the provisions of sections 59 to 61 of the Indian Contract Act, 1872, it was held that the said provisions get attracted only when more than one debt is due from the debtor to the creditor 6 / 10 LAW FINDER Submitted By: Nitish Garg PDF downloaded from the online archives of Chawla Publications(P) Ltd.", "page": 6}, {"source": "Delhi Development Authority v.

Further, Sections 59 to 61 do not have direct application in a case where the debt due has merged with the decree and the applicable rule then would be what is provided in the decree itself or the general rule applicable in execution of decrees. Reference was made to Industrial Credit and Development Syndicate (now called I.C.D.S. Ltd.) v. Smithaben H. Patel (Smt.) and Others (1999) 3 SCC 80 wherein this Court had held that sections 59 and 60 of the Indian Contract Act would be applicable only at pre-decretal stage and not thereafter, since post- decretal payments are to be made either in terms of the decree or in terms of the agreement arrived at between the parties, though on general principles as mentioned in Sections 59 and 60. Accordingly, the general rule of appropriation towards decretal amount is that the amount has to be adjusted strictly in accordance with the directions contained in the decree and in the absence of directions, adjustment must be first made in payment of interest and costs and thereafter in payment of principal amount. Reference was also made to the amendment made to Order XXI Rule 1 in 1996 by enacting sub- Rules (4) and (5) to observe as under: \"25. In the Objects and Reasons for amendment of Order 21, Rule 1, it was set out as follows: \"The Committee notes that there is no provision in the Code in relation to cessation of interest on the money paid under a decree, out of court, to a decree-holder, by postal money order or through a bank or by any other mode wherein payment is evidenced in writing. The Committee is of the view that, in such a case, the interest should cease to run", "page": 7}, {"source": "Delhi Development Authority v.

The Committee is of the view that, in such a case, the interest should cease to run from the date of such payment. In case the decree-holder refuses to accept the postal money order or payment through a bank, interest should cease to run from the date on which the money was tendered to him in ordinary course of business of the postal authorities or the bank. Sub-rule (5) in Rule 1 Order 21 has been inserted accordingly.\" The legislative intent in enacting sub-rules (4) and (5) is therefore clear and it is that interest should cease on the deposit being made and notice given or on the amount being tendered outside the court in the manner provided. Mulla in his Commentary on the Code of Civil Procedure, 15th Edn., Vol. II at p. 1583 has set out the effect of the rules as follows: \"Normal rule with respect to money decree is (i) the appropriation of payments towards satisfaction of interest in the first instance, and (ii) then towards principal amount. But this became inoperative, after the amendment of Rule 1 Order 21 CPC. section 60 of the Contract Act cannot be invoked for the application of the aforesaid normal rule.\" 26. Thus, in cases of execution of money decrees or award-decrees, or rather, decrees other than mortgage decrees, interest ceases to run on the amount deposited, to the extent of the deposit. It is true that if the amount falls short, the decree-holder may be entitled to apply the rule of appropriation by appropriating the amount first towards the interest, then towards the costs and", "page": 7}, {"source": "Delhi Development Authority v.

It is true that if the amount falls short, the decree-holder may be entitled to apply the rule of appropriation by appropriating the amount first towards the interest, then towards the costs and then towards the principal amount due under the decree. But the fact remains that to the extent of the deposit, no further interest is payable thereon to the decree-holder and there is no question of the decree-holder claiming a re-appropriation when it is found that more amounts are due to him and the same is also deposited by the judgment-debtor. In other words, the scheme does not contemplate a reopening of the satisfaction to the extent it has occurred by the deposit. No further interest would run on the sum appropriated towards the principal.\" 16. This Court in Bharat Heavy Electricals Limited v. R.S. Avtar Singh and Company (2013) 1 SCC 243 had again examined the aspect of apportionment in the factual background of that case and with reference to Section 33 of the Code and section 3(3)(c) of the Interest Act, 1978 on which 7 / 10 LAW FINDER Submitted By: Nitish Garg PDF downloaded from the online archives of Chawla Publications(P) Ltd.", "page": 7}, {"source": "Delhi Development Authority v.

Crystallising the legal position and ratio in terms of Gurpreet Singh (supra), it was held:- \"31. From what has been stated in the said decision, the following principles emerge: 31.1. The general rule of appropriation towards a decretal amount was that such an amount was to be adjusted strictly in accordance with the directions contained in the decree and in the absence of such directions adjustments be made firstly towards payment of interest and costs and thereafter towards payment of the principal amount subject, of course, to any agreement between the parties. 31.2. The legislative intent in enacting sub-rules (4) and (5) is a clear pointer that interest should cease to run on the deposit made by the judgment-debtor and notice given or on the amount being tendered outside the court in the manner provided in Order 21, Rule 1 (1)(b). 31.3. If the payment made by the judgment-debtor falls short of the decreed amount, the decree-holder will be entitled to apply the general rule of appropriation by appropriating the amount deposited towards the interest, then towards costs and finally towards the principal amount due under the decree. 31.4. Thereafter, no further interest would run on the sum appropriated towards the principal. In other words if a part of the principal amount has been paid along with interest due thereon as on the date of issuance of notice of deposit interest on that part of the principal sum will cease to run thereafter. 31.5.

As far as the contention based on section 34 CPC having regard to the general rule of appropriation in cases of this nature where there is a short payment made pursuant to the decree, we do not find any conflict with the said provision insofar as it related to payment of interest to be payable by the appellant. As far as the submission made, based on section 3(3)(c) of the Interest Act, 1978 is concerned, the said provision only states dehors the substantive part of said Section 3, the courts are not empowered to award interest upon interest. We do not find any scope to apply the said section to the case on hand where the controversy is subsequent to the decree where direction for payment of interest on the award amount has been spelt out. The issue related to the correctness of the interest calculated as per the decree of the Court which made the award its rule. The challenge is not to the decree on the footing that it was in violation of section 3(3)(c) of the Interest Act.

He can if he likes take the money out in terms of the order; but so long as he does not do it, there is nothing to prevent the judgment debtor from taking it out by furnishing other security, say, of immovable property, if the court allows him to do so and on his losing the appeal putting the decretal amount in court in terms of Order 21, Rule 1 CPC in satisfaction of the decree. 13. The real effect of deposit of money in court as was done in this case is to put the money beyond the reach of the parties pending the disposal of the appeal.

On this aspect, we do not agree with the reasoning of the Division Bench of the High Court that the respondent was not served with the notice of deposit of the amount by relying upon the decision of this Court in Mathunni Mathai (supra). The decision in the case of Mathunni Mathai (supra) was under the Land Acquisition Act, 1894 and in Prem Nath Kapur (supra) it was held to have not laid down the correct law as sections 34 and 38 of the Land Acquisition Act, 1894 were differently worded. The Constitution Bench in Gurpreet Singh (supra), while affirming the ratio in Prem Nath Kapur (supra) on the question of appropriation, had held that in Mathunni Mathai (supra) this Court had not considered the question whether there was any deviation from the normal rule of appropriation by virtue of provisions of the Land Acquisition Act, 1894. Further, and importantly for the present case, it was observed and held in Gurpreet Singh (supra) that in Mathunni Mathai (supra) this Court had observed in paragraph 4 at page 31 as under: \"It is not necessary for purposes of this case to decide whether the creditor was bound to appropriate the amount towards principal once it was deposited in court and intimation of the deposit was served on the decree-holder as it does not appear that the respondent ever served any notice on the appellant about the deposit.\" 19.

In the context of the present case, it is obvious that the respondent was aware of the deposit of Rs.58,80,380/- made by the appellant as the respondent had filed an application for withdrawal of the amount during the pendency of FAO (OS) No. 93 of 2002. The respondent cannot plead that it is neither aware of the deposit nor served with any notice of the deposit of the amount. The learned single judge in the judgment dated 15th July 2005 had obviously lost notice of the fact that Rs.58,80,380/- has already been deposited in the Court. The respondent, it is obvious, did not bring the deposit to the notice of the Court in order to gain advantage and benefit of higher rate of interest by pleading that the appellant was not entitled to lower rate of interest. The amount deposited by the appellant in terms of the interim order passed in FAO (OS) No. 93 of 2002 was obviously made with the intent that the amount would be released and paid to the respondent, on 9 / 10 LAW FINDER Submitted By: Nitish Garg PDF downloaded from the online archives of Chawla Publications(P) Ltd.", "page": 9}, {"source": "Delhi Development Authority v.

The appellant while going on road on 4.12.1990 became victim of an accident, because of the rash and negligent driving of the scooter by respondent No. 1 (hereinafter referred to as the 'respondent'). The appellant suffered serious injuries and was admitted in Badwah Hospital, the same day. On 7.12.1990 he was shifted to M.Y. Hospital, Indore and was treated as an indoor patient till 27.9.1991.

The claim petition for compensation was filed before the Additional Motor Accident Claims Tribunal, Badwah (hereafter referred to as the 'Tribunal') on 7.12.1991 along with an application or condonation of delay which was of four days only. The Tribunal by its order dated 18.11.1993 condoned the delay in filing the claim petition. The validity of the said order was challenged by the respondent before the High Court of Madhya Pradesh at Jabalpur. The High Court by its order date 31.7.1995 set aside the order of the Tribunal aforesaid condoning the delay saying that in view of sub-section (3) of Section 166 of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988 (hereinafter referred to as the 'Act') the power of condonation by the Tribunal has been withdrawn and any claim must be filed within the period prescribed therein. The High Court further observed that by prescribing the fixed period for filing the petition, the intention was that the 'sword of liability of paying compensation in respect of accident caused by motor vehicle should not be permitted to hover on the head of the person owning the said vehicle and person driving such vehicle.' It was also pointed out that the position was different under the Motor Vehicles Act, 1939 in which sub-section (3) of Section 110-A although prescribed a period of six months for filing an application for compensation from the date of the accident, but vested power in Tribunal to entertain such application even after the expiry of the said period of six months, if the Tribunal was satisfied that the claimant was prevented by sufficient cause from making the application in time. 3.

The Act which repealed the earlier Motor Vehicles Act of 1939 came in force w.e.f. 1.7.1989. The new Act prescribed a period of limitation for filing the claim petition in sub- section (3) of Section 166. Said sub-section provided: ''No application for such compensation shall be entertained unless it is made within six months of the occurrence of the accident. Provided that the Claims Tribunal may entertain the application after the expiry of the said period of six months but not later than twelve months, if it is satisfied that the applicant was prevented by sufficient cause from making the application in time.'' 5. According to the Court, as proviso to sub-section (3) of Section 166 of the Act said that Claims Tribunal may entertain the application after the expiry of the said period of six months 'but not later than twelve months', any application filed beyond the period of twelve months from the date of the accident cannot be entertained as no discretion had been left with the Tribunal to consider the circumstances because of which the application for claim could not be filed within", "page": 2}, {"source": "Dhannalal v.

Before the scope of sub-section (3) of Section 166 of the Act is examined, it may be pointed out that the aforesaid sub-section (3) of Section 166 of the Act has been omitted by Section 53 of the Motor Vehicles (Amendment) Act, 1994 which came in force w.e.f. 14.11.1994. The effect of the Amending Act is that w.e.f. 14.11.1994 there is no limitation for filing claims before the Tribunal in respect of any accident. It can be said that Parliament realised the grave injustice and injury which was being caused to the Page 2 of 4 Law Finder DocId # 36567 Licensed to: Sh.Naresh Garg,Advocate Bathinda Punjab 08-10-2022 Law Finder", "page": 2}, {"source": "Dhannalal v.

It is a matter of common knowledge that majority of the claimants for such compensation are ignorant about the period during which such claims should be preferred. After the death due to the accident, of the bread earner of the family, in many cases such claimants are virtually on the streets. Even in cases where the victims escape death some of such victims are hospitalised for months if not for years. In the present case itself the applicant claims that he met with the accident on 4.12.1990 and he was being treated as an indoor patent till 27.9.1991. According to us, in its wisdom the Parliament, rightly thought that prescribing a period of limitation and restricting the power of Tribunal to entertain any claim petition beyond the period of twelve months from the date of the accident was harsh, inequitable and in many cases was likely to cause injustice to the claimants. The present case is a glaring example where the appellant has been deprived by the order of the High Court from claiming the compensation because of delay of only four days in preferring the claim petition. 7. In this background, now it has to be examined as to what is the effect of omission of sub-section (3) of Section 166 of the Act. From the Amending Act it does not appear that the said sub-section (3) has been deleted retrospectively. But at the same time, there is nothing in the Amending Act to show that benefit of deletion of sub-section (3) of Section 166 is not to be extended to pending claim petitions where a plea of limitation has been raised.

But at the same time, there is nothing in the Amending Act to show that benefit of deletion of sub-section (3) of Section 166 is not to be extended to pending claim petitions where a plea of limitation has been raised. The effect of deletion of sub-section (3) from Section 166 of the Act can be tested by an illustration. Suppose an accident had taken place two years before 14.11.1994 when sub-section (3) was omitted from Section 166. For one reason or the other no claim petition had been filed by the victim or the heirs of the victim till 14.11.1994. Can a claim petition be not filed after 14.11.1994 in respect of such accident ? Whether a claim petition filed after 14.11.1994 can be rejected by the Tribunal on the ground of limitation saying that the period of twelve months which had been prescribed when sub-section (3) of Section 166 was in force having expired the right to prefer the claim petition had been extinguished and shall not be revived after deletion of sub-section (3) of Section 166 w.e.f. 14.11.1994 ? According to us, the answer should be in negative. When sub-section (3) of Section 166 has been omitted, then the Tribunal has to entertain a claim petition without taking note of the date on which such accident had taken place. The claim petitions cannot be thrown out on the ground that such claim petitions were barred by time when sub-section (3) of Section 166 was in force.

One such amendment has been introduced in the Act by the aforesaid Amendment Act 54 of 1994 by substituting sub-section (6) of Section 158 which provides: ''As soon as any information regarding any accident involving death or bodily injury to any person is recorded or report under this section is completed by a police officer, the office incharge of the police station shall forward a copy of the same within thirty days from the date of recording of information or, as the case may be, on completion of such report to the Claims Tribunal having jurisdiction and a copy thereof to the concerned insurer, and where a copy is made available to the owner, he shall also within thirty days of receipt of such reports, forward the same to such Claims Tribunal and Insurer.'' In view of sub-section (6) of Section 158 of the Act the officer incharge of the police station is enjoined to forward a copy of information/report regarding the accident to the Tribunal having jurisdiction. A copy thereof has also to be forwarded to the concerned insurer. It also requires that where a copy is made available to the owner of the vehicle, he shall within thirty days of receipt of such copy forward the same to the Claims Tribunal and insurer.

The present appeal is one such case. The appellant has been pursuing from Tribunal to this Court. His right to get compensation in connection with the accident in question is being resisted by the respondents on the ground of delay in filing the same. If he had not filed any petition for claim till 14.11.1994 in respect of the accident which took place on 4.12.1990, in view of the Amending Act he became entitled to file such claim petition, the period of limitation having been deleted, the claim petition which has been filed and is being pursued upto this Court cannot be thrown out on the ground of limitation. 8. The matter will be different if any claimant having filed a petition for claim beyond time which has been rejected by the Tribunal or the High Court, the claimant does not challenge the same and allows the said judicial order to become final. The aforesaid Amending Act shall be of no help to such claimant. The reason being that a judicial order saying that such petition of claim was barred by limitation has attained finality.

Mr. R.S. Longia, learned counsel for the petitioners submits that respondent No.2 filed a petition under Section 22-C of 1987 Act on the ground that the petitioners had issued bills on the average basis for the months of April 2014 to November 2014 and in the month of November 2014, moved an application for changing/replacement of the meter. In the month of March 2015, the petitioners changed the electric meter and thereafter, started issuing bills on consumption basis but on 8.6.2015 issued a bill of 76,267 including the amount of 74,104/- as arrears on the premise that at that time the reading of old meter was 17913 and the new meter was installed at 0 reading. After installation of the new meter, the consumer consumed 143 units and on the basis of the consumption, the account of the consumer was overhauled by taking the last reading 17913. Accordingly, the demand was raised. 3. He further submits that the aforementioned connection was in the name of Kali Ram This judgement ranked 1 in the hitlist.

The finding of the Lok Adalat is erroneous and illegal, much less capricious on the premise that it was on request of the consumer, the meter was replaced. On replacement, he had consumed the units aforementioned. On the basis of aforementioned calculation, the demand was raised. The demand is perfectly legal and justified as per the consumption of units on replacement. The aforementioned dispute involved intricate question of facts and law which could have been only adjudicated in civil Court and not by the Lok Adalat, therefore, it did not have the jurisdiction to try and entertain the application. He further submits that the meter reading reported 0 reading from April 2014 to November 2014 and the average bills had been issued. When the consumer objected to the same, meter was replaced on 18.02.2015. The bills were accordingly issued, therefore, the Lok Adalat was totally wrong in allowing the complaint. There was no material on record to show that the meter was reported O.K during April 2014 to March 2015 allegedly noticed by the Lok Adalat. The consumer had made a request for checking of the meter replacing the same. When the meter reader reported 0 reading, it was replaced. The meter was actually got checked from M&T Lab and found dead stopped on its counter display vide lab report dated 13.03.2015 (Annexure P-5). Since the petitioners were required to controvert the case but the report of the Lab indicated the slow running of the meter.

The alleged inspection is in his absence. Such an action is wanting compliance of principles of natural justice. 5. In support of his contention, relies upon the ratio decidendi culled out by the Hon'ble Division Bench of this Court in M/s Tirupati Industries v.

The conceded position on record as per the averments is that the aforementioned meter was checked in the laboratory on 13.03.2015 (Annexure P-5) but the said report reveals that inspection was done in the absence of the consumer. 8. It is settled law that inspection of the meter has to be done in the laboratory in the presence of the consumer. Having failed to do so, the alleged demand of arrears on the basis of checking by overhauling the account is fatal to the claim of the Board. 9. There is another aspect of the matter.

The consumer got worried and requested for replacement of meter in February 2015. The authorities are enjoined upon an obligation to raise the demand after compliance of the principles of natural justice. Having adhered to the aforementioned fact, in my view, the demand was rightly set aside by the Lok Adalat. 10. I do not find any illegality and perversity in the same.

In our opinion, failure of the concerned authorities and the Committees to supply a copy of the report sent by M.E.

The rule of hearing and the rule of fairness in State action which form part of the concept of rule of law imposes an obligation on the State and its agencies/instrumentalities to give notice and opportunity of hearing and also to disclose reason for their actions which may adversely affect the rights of a person or which may visit such person with evil consequences. The rule that no man can be condemned unheard has been treated as an integral part of the concept of rule of law which permeates the scheme of our Constitution. The thin line of distinction between purely administrative actions and quasi judicial actions has been completely obliterated by the judicial verdicts. More than 30 years ago, their Lordships of the Supreme Court in State of Orissa v. Dr. (Miss) Binapani Dei and Others, AIR 1967 Supreme Court 1269 ruled that even administrative decisions may be invalidated on the ground of violation of the principles of natural justice. Some of the observations made in that action are extracted below : \"An order by the State to the prejudice of a person in derogation of his vested rights may be made only in accordance with the basic rules of justice and fair play. The deciding authority, it is true, is not in the position of a Judge called upon to decide an action between contesting parties, and strict compliance with the forms of judicial procedure may not be insisted upon. He is, however, under a duty to give the person against whom an enquiry is held an opportunity to set up his version or defence and an opportunity to correct or to controvert any evidence in the possession of the authority which is sought to be relied upon to his prejudice.", "page": 3}, {"source": "Dakshin Vs PLA PSPCL.pdf", "chunk_id": 1, "text": "is, however, under a duty to give the person against whom an enquiry is held an opportunity to set up his version or defence and an opportunity to correct or to controvert any evidence in the possession of the authority which is sought to be relied upon to his prejudice. For that purpose the person against whom an enquiry is held must be informed of the case he is called upon to meet, and the evidence in support thereof. The rule that a party to whose prejudice an order is intended to be passed is entitled to a hearing applies alike to judicial tribunals and bodies of persons invested with authority to adjudicate upon matters involving civil consequences. It is one of the fundamental rules of our constitutional setup that every citizen is protected against exercise for arbitrary authority by the State or its officers. Duty to act judicially would, therefore, arise from the very nature of the function intended to be performed; it need not be shown to be super-added. If there is power to decide and determine to the prejudice of a persons, duty to act judicially is implicit in the exercise of such power. If the essentials of justice be ignored and an order to the prejudice of a person is made, the order is a nullity. That is a basic concept of the rule of law and importance thereof transcends the significance of a decision in any particular case....

Learned counsel for the appellant contended that it was a new vehicle. The appellant has already deposited the necessary fees along with application on 19.02.2013 for issuance of the route permit and the route permit was even issued on 27.02.2013. The accident has also taken place on 19.02.2013 in the evening, whereas the owner of the vehicle has already submitted the documents in the Transport Office for grant of permit along with the requisite fees. So, it cannot be stated that the vehicle in question was being plied without permit. To support his contentions, he relied upon case Ashok Kumar Khemaka v. Oriental Insurance Company Ltd. And others 2014(3) RCR (Civil) 1018. He further contended that as the truck was being plied in the State of Punjab, so there was no need of any route permit. To support his contentions he relied upon case National Insurance Company Limited v. Kamlesh Kaur and others 2006(3) RCR (Civil) 634 and Moti Ram v. ICICI Lombard and others 2015 ACJ 1793.

The registration certificate was issued on 26.02.2013 and the permit was issued on 27.02.2013. This accident has taken place on 19.02.2013. So, we have to see as to whether the vehicle in question was having a permit on 19.02.2013 or not. Section 66 Sub Section (1) of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988 (hereinafter called the \"Act\") reads as under:- \"66. Necessity for permits. \u2013 (1) No owner of a motor vehicle shall use or permit the use of the vehicle as a transport vehicle in any public place whether or not such vehicle is actually carrying any passengers or goods save in accordance with the conditions of a permit granted or countersigned by a Regional or State Transport Authority or any prescribed authority authorising him the use of the vehicle in that place in the manner in which the vehicle is being used : Provided that a stage carriage permit shall, subject to any conditions that may be specified in the permit, authorise the use of the vehicle as a contract carriage: Provided further that a stage carriage permit may, subject to any conditions that may be specified in the permit, authorise the use of the vehicle as a good carriage either when carrying passengers or not : Provided also that a goods carriage permit shall, subject to any conditions that may be specified in the permit, authorise the holder to use the vehicle for the carriage of goods for or in connection with a trade or business carried on by him.\" 6.

Tata (P & H Route Permit).docx", "chunk_id": 3, "text": "the permit, authorise the holder to use the vehicle for the carriage of goods for or in connection with a trade or business carried on by him.\" 6. As per the aforesaid provision of law the transport vehicle can only be used in accordance with the conditions of the permit granted. Thus, the permit is necessary to ply the transport vehicle on the road. The Hon'ble Apex Court in case National Insurance Company Ltd. v. Chella Bharathamma 2004(4) RCR (Civil) 399 has laid down as under:- \"High Court was of the view that since there was no permit, the question of violation of any condition thereof does not arise. The view is clearly fallacious. A person without permit to ply a vehicle cannot be placed at a better pedestal vis-a-vis one who has a permit, but has violated any condition thereof. Plying of a vehicle without a permit is an infraction. Therefore, in terms of Section 149(2) defence is available to the insurer on that aspect. The acceptability of the stand is a matter of adjudication. The question of policy being operative had no relevance for the issue regarding liability of insurer. High Court was, therefore, not justified in holding the insurer liable.\" 7. In view of the aforesaid statutory provision as well as authoritative pronouncement of the Hon'ble Apex Court, the permit is necessary to ply the transport vehicle. The absence of the permit is a valid defence to the insurer under Section 149 Sub Section (2) of the Act. 8. In the instant case, the accident has taken place on 19.02.2013.

In the instant case, the accident has taken place on 19.02.2013. Learned counsel for the appellant has alleged that on that very day before the accident the appellant has already applied for issuance of the permit. To buttress his arguments, he drawn my attention to receipt Annexure-A1 but the said receipt leads us no where to conclude that vide that receipt the application was submitted for issuance of the permit. This receipt has been issued by the Punjab Motor Vehicles Department. It bears the chassis number of the vehicle and name of the owner. In the body of the receipt it has been shown as under: 9. This receipt nowhere depicts that the said receipt relates to the submission of the application for issuance of the permit. So, the appellant has not been able to establish that he has submitted the application for issuance of the permit before this accident. Moreover, mere filing of the application will not comply with the provisions of Section 66 of the Act. Section 66 provides that no transport vehicle can be used without permit. Thus, mere submission of the application for issuance of the permit cannot make the owner of a transport vehicle entitled to ply the vehicle. It is the admitted case of the appellant that the permit was issued on 27.02.2013 i.e. after eight days of the accident. So, it is established that on the date of accident i.e. 19.02.2013, there was no permit to ply the vehicle in question, which was clearly a violation of the terms and conditions of the insurance policy and no fault can be found in the findings of the learned Tribunal giving the recovery rights to respondent No.1 Insurance Company against the insured. 10.

The cases relied upon by learned counsel for the appellant are quite distinguishable on facts. In cases National Insurance Company Ltd. v. Kamlesh Kaur and others (supra), the Insurance Company has not been able to establish that there was no permit for plying the vehicle and it was held that no route permit is required to operate the vehicle within the State. Similarly in case Moti Ram v. ICICI Lombard and others (supra) this court has held that there is no requirement to possess a route permit. Section 2(31) of the Act provides only for permit and Section 149 of the Act is silent about the route permit. In case Ashok Kumar Khemka and another v. Oriental Insurance Company (supra) also this Court has simply laid down that there is no requirement of law to possess a route permit. Section 2(31) of the Act talks about the permit only and Section 149 of the Act is silent about the route permit. There is no discussion in the entire judgment that the payment of the taxes by the owner will do away with the requirement of the permit as required under Section 66 of the Act. Para No.2 of the aforesaid judgment quoted by learned counsel for the appellant wherein these facts are mentioned, are only the contentions raised by learned counsel for the appellant and not the findings of the Court. 11.

(Oral) - This is an appeal filed by the owner of the vehicle challenging the Award dated 01.12.2016 passed by Motor Accidents Claims Tribunal, Kurukshetra, in so far as it absolves the Insurance Company from the liability of payment of the compensation. 2. Brief facts of this case are that on 14.06.1995, Kamal Sharma, along with 54 other pilgrims, left Kurukshetra at about 8.00 AM. They had to go to Haridwar, Ayodhya, Nepal and Jagan Nath Puri etc. They were in the Bus bearing registration No.UP-10B-0939, which was being driven by one Raju Karki, resident of Delhi. It is claimed in the claim petition that the bus was taken for journey after getting permission from Regional Transport Controller, Haridwar as well as from Managing Director, Garhwal Vikas Nigam, Haridwar. On the intervening night of 17/18.06.1995, the bus in question was on its way to Kathmandu via Sonali.

On the intervening night of 17/18.06.1995, the bus in question was on its way to Kathmandu via Sonali. At about 2.00 AM, when the said bus, in which the deceased-Kamal Sharma was travelling along with other pilgrims, reached in the area of Chitwan, District Chandi Bhajan, Village Vikas Samiti, Ward No.5, situated in Parevar Bhir near bridge No.2, at the distance of two kilometers from Naraingarh, the driver of the Bus lost control and the bus in question fell in Trishuli Nadi. All the 54 persons died in the accident. No dead body of the any pilgrim could be traced as the said river was about 30 meters deep. On account of death of these persons, several claim petitions were filed, one of them was of Sona Devi and others. The present petition was filed by Roop Kumar Sharma on account of death of Kamal Sharma. 3. The parties led their evidence. The owner of the bus produced in evidence, the cover note of the insurance of the vehicle in question along with the schedule of the policy. The Insurance Company also produced the alleged copy of insurance policy as Ex. R-4. 4. After hearing the counsel for the parties and perusing the record, the Tribunal determined the quantum of compensation to be L 4,34,500/-. 5. However, relying upon the policy Ex. R-4, the Tribunal absolved the Insurance Company from making the payment of the compensation on the ground that the policy did not cover the operation of the bus in Nepal. Since the accident occurred in Nepal so the Insurance Company is not liable. 6.

While arguing the case, the counsel for the appellant submits that there was no limitation for use of the vehicle in terms of geographical area; as per the policy issued for this vehicle, the schedule of which is also produced on record along with the cover note as Ex R-3. 7. The next argument of learned counsel for the appellant is that Ex. P-12 is permit of the said bus, which authorised the bus to travel to area of Nepal. It is further submitted that the issue, whether the claim petition can be filed in India; if the accident occurred in Nepal, has already been considered by this Court in FAO No.429 of 1998 decided on 30.11.2010 titled as Sona Devi v. Amil Kumar and others. Counsel for the appellant submits that in that case, the Tribunal held that the claim petition is not maintainable in India, if the accident had taken place out of India. However, this Court remanded the matter to the Tribunal for the decision of the same, on merits, after holding that claim petition can be filed in India. 8. Counsel further submits that since there is no restriction in the policy regarding the use of the vehicle outside geographical territory of India, therefore, the Insurance Company is liable to make the payments. 9. On the other hand, learned counsel for the respondent-Insurance Company has submitted that since the policy produced on record as Ex. R-4 is limited to cover the vehicle to be used only in the geographical area of India, therefore, the Insurance Company is not liable for payment of compensation on account of any accident"}, {"source": "Anil Kumar v.

After hearing learned counsel for the parties and perusing the records, this Court is of the considered opinion that the submissions made by learned counsel for the appellant deserve to be accepted. 11. Motor Vehicles Act has made elaborate provisions regarding compulsory insurance of vehicle qua damage to the third party in any accident involving the insured vehicle at any public place. Likewise, the liability of the Insurance Company to indemnify the insured has also been made compulsory by the Act. Section 146 of the Act makes the provision for necessity of insurance of vehicle before taking it out on road. Section 147 of the Act determines the extent of liability of the Insurance Company. A perusal of Section 147 of the Act clarifies the limits of liability of Insurance Company and the requirements of policy of insurance. 12. A bare perusal of Sections 146 and 147 of the Act makes it clear that the insurance policy is attached to the 'vehicle' in question and not to Geographical expense of the area of operation of the vehicle in question. The only requirement for coming in operation of the policy liability is; the use of vehicle in any public place. Therefore, the Insurance Company cannot avoid its liability to pay the compensation only on the ground that the vehicle was used in any particular city, state or a particular geographical area. Once a vehicle is insured qua third party it is insured for all geographical areas as"}, {"source": "Anil Kumar v.

Therefore, the Insurance Company cannot avoid its liability to pay the compensation only on the ground that the vehicle was used in any particular city, state or a particular geographical area. Once a vehicle is insured qua third party it is insured for all geographical areas as per the provisions of the Act. Only plea the Insurance Company can take to avoid its liability qua third party can be; that the vehicle was not being plied in a particular geographical area in accordance with the provisions of the Act, if any, prescribed for that purpose. Every extent of liability qua third party is covered by the consolidated amount of premium required to be paid for insurance qua third party only. Therefore to cover liability qua third party in any particular geographical area the insured cannot even be asked to pay any extra premium under the provisions of the Act. So the Insurance Company cannot even avoid its liability qua third party, on the ground that it can charge extra premium to cover any particular geographical area and that the insured has not paid that extra premium to cover that particular geographical area. Once insured, the vehicle is insured to cover all geographical areas; where the vehicle is authorised by the authorities to travel. 13. One can come across a thought that the Motor Vehicles Act extends only to 'whole of India' as per its section 1, so it does not cover the area outside India. However, this rational also does not exempt the Insurance Company from liability arising from the usage of the vehicle outside the geographical area of the Union of India. This section also implies that the Act would be applicable to all the citizens and subjects of India qua all the Motor Vehicular aspects"}, {"source": "Anil Kumar v.

This section also implies that the Act would be applicable to all the citizens and subjects of India qua all the Motor Vehicular aspects in India. It does not exclude the liability of one citizen or entity of India qua the other citizen of India even if the same is incurred outside the geographical area of Union of India, particularly, when the liability is arising from the use of vehicle registered and insured in India. The extra-territorial jurisdiction of a sovereign nation state over its citizen and their rights and liabilities is well recognised concept of jurisprudence. The sovereign Nation State has plenary powers to make law regarding its citizens and subjects; irrespective of territorial limits, may be, for enforcement of such law in another country the reciprocity may be required. Extra-territorial jurisdiction of a nation state is, jurisprudentially valid on the basis of the 'causes and effects' qua the territory, citizens, subjects and objects of a nation state. Indian Parliament too has this power to legislate for extraterritorial causes and effects, as clarified by Article 245 of the Constitution of India. Hence the Motor Vehicles Act shall also govern the rights and liabilities of citizens and subjects of India; arising from the provisions of Motor Vehicles Act, irrespective of territorial limits. 14. This intention of the Parliament to give extraterritorial effect to the provisions of this aspect of the Act is further clarified by the provisions; as contained in Sections 139 and 149 of the Motor Vehicles Act.

Section 149 (3) makes the Insurance Company liable to satisfy the decree or award for the accidents occurring outside India, even if the same is passed by a foreign Court, but according to provision of Section 149. If the award of a foreign Court passed as per provisions of Section 149 of the Act is enforceable against an Insurance Company in India, then there is no question of the liability of Insurance Company being excluded in Courts in India on the ground that accident occurred outside India. 15. It is not even disputed by learned counsel for the respondents that the bus in question had the necessary permission to ply in the area of Nepal. Therefore, its insurance policy would be deemed to be validly permitted to travel in the area of travel of the bus. Hence, for the liability arising from the accident involving the vehicle entitled to ply in Nepal, the insurer of the vehicle would be very much liable to make the payment. 16. Still further, the bare perusal of the policy shows that the policy and the schedule produced on record by the appellant do not show any restriction of geographical area in terms of exclusion of the liability of the insurer.

The policy produced on record by the appellant shows that this policy does not have any restriction against plying the vehicle outside India. In the name of limitation as to use, only organised racing, reliability test and speed testing have been excluded; in terms of the Motor Vehicles Act. There is no such clause mentioned; as excluding liability of the Insurance Company; for an accident happening outside India. 17. A though, the copy of the insurance policy produced on record by the Insurance Company as Ex. R-4 contains a vague writing, which speaks \"Geographical area/zone India\". However, comparison of the policies Exhibits R-3 and R-4 show that the policy numbers on these two policies are different. The policy Ex. R-4 carries different details regarding the premium paid and even regarding the details of the vehicle insured. So, it is obvious that the Insurance Company has tried to place on record the insurance policy not pertaining to the bus in question to avoid its liability. This attempt has been made by the Insurance Company; only for one reason that this policy contains stipulation regarding the 'geographical area/zone' which mentions 'India', whereas the original policy/cover note produced by the appellant does not show any such restriction. Therefore, on the basis of this policy Exhibit R-4, which is not even proved to be the policy of the bus in question, the Insurance Company can not avoid its liability to make the payment of the compensation, awarded on account of accident involving the vehicle in question. 18.

Faced with this situation, learned counsel for the respondent-Insurance Company submits that the limitation for liability of insurance qua area of operation outside India has been defined by 'India Motor Tariff' and therefore, Insurance Company cannot be held liable for any accident which occurred outside the territorial limits of Union of India. 19. For that purpose, the counsel relies upon the document Ex. R-7, which contains a specimen of the endorsement advised to be included in the policy. However, this document itself is not a legal document to exclude the statutory liability of Insurance Company. This is only a suggestion of the Advisory Committee. This was required to be included in the policy by individual Insurance Company, if at all considered appropriate and desirable by it, while insuring a vehicle. This document in itself is not sufficient to exclude the liability of the Insurance Company in an accident which occurred outside the territorial jurisdiction of India. 20. As stated above, nothing has been placed on record by the Insurance Company to show that the insurance policy regarding this particular vehicle contained this stipulation and endorsement as advised by 'India Motor Tariff'. Moreover, it is not on record; as to since when the respondent-Insurance Company started to follow this 'India Motor Tariff' Advisory, if at all, it follows the same. 21. Moreover, the competence of 'India Motor Tariff' to issue such instruction to limit the liability of Insurance Company in terms of geographical area has not been shown by the Insurance Company. No such instructions; which run counter to or dilute the liability of Insurance Company as defined under Sections 146 to 149 of the Act can be countenanced by the Court. 22.

On the contrary, in the written statement, the Insurance Company has taken the stand that their liability is limited to the extent of L 50,000/- only. Therefore, the argument of learned counsel for the Insurance Company, otherwise also, is beyond the pleadings. Hence, the same can not be accepted by this Court. 23. In view of the above, the findings of the Tribunal, to the extent of the exclusion of the liability of the Insurance Company, and the consequent Award to that extent, is set aside.

The appellant issued the notice calling the first respondent to pay the legally enforceable debt of Rs. 20,00,000: \u201cTherefore, my client hereby calls upon you to make payment of Rs. 20,00,000/- towards the legally enforceable debt due and payable by you within a period of 15 days from the date of receipt of this particular notice, [\u2026]\u201d 3. On 25 April 2014, the first respondent addressed a response to the statutory notice where he alleged the following: (i) The first respondent and the appellant are related to each other. The appellant\u2019s son married the first respondent\u2019s sister; (ii) The appellant lent the first respondent a loan of rupees forty lakhs. There was an oral agreement between the parties that the first respondent would pay rupees one lakh every three months by cheque and rupees eighty thousand in cash to the appellant.

On 12 May 2014, the appellant filed a criminal complaint against the first respondent for the offence under Section 138 of the Act. On 19 May 2014, the first respondent issued another reply to the legal notice. By the said reply, the earlier reply to the legal notice was sought to be amended by replacing the acknowledgment of having received a loan of rupees forty lakhs to rupees twenty lakhs. 5. By a judgment dated 30 August 2016, the Trial Court acquitted the first respondent of the offence under Section 138 on the ground that the first respondent paid the appellant a sum of rupees 4,09,315 between 8 April 2012 and 30 December 2013 partly discharging his liability in respect of the debt of rupees twenty lakhs.

The appellant filed an appeal against the judgment of the Trial Court before the High Court of Gujarat. On 10 October 2019, the first respondent moved an application before the High Court of Gujarat seeking to place on record the amended reply dated 19 May 2014. By an order dated 11 October 2018, the High Court allowed the application for placing the additional evidence on record.

The Analysis 9. The rival submissions fall for our consideration. Section 138 of the Act reads as follows: \u201c138. Dishonour of cheque for insufficiency, etc., of funds in the account.\u2014Where any cheque drawn by a person on an account maintained by him with a banker for payment of any amount of money to another person from out of that account for the discharge, in whole or in part, of any debt or other liability, is returned by the bank unpaid, either because of the amount of money standing to the credit of that account is insufficient to honour the cheque or that it exceeds the amount arranged to be paid from that account by an agreement made with that bank, such person shall be deemed to have committed an offence and shall, without prejudice to any other provision of this Act, be punished with imprisonment for 8 [a term which may be extended to two years\u2019], or with fine which may extend to twice the amount of the cheque, or with both: Provided that nothing contained in this section shall apply unless\u2014 (a) the cheque has been presented to the bank within a period of six months from the date on which it is drawn or within the period of its validity, whichever is earlier; (b) the payee or the holder in due", "page": 6}, {"source": "Dashrath Vs Hitesh SC Sec 56 NI Act Part Payment Cheque.pdf", "chunk_id": 1, "text": "that nothing contained in this section shall apply unless\u2014 (a) the cheque has been presented to the bank within a period of six months from the date on which it is drawn or within the period of its validity, whichever is earlier; (b) the payee or the holder in due course of the cheque, as the case may be, makes a demand for the payment of the said amount of money by giving a notice; in writing, to the drawer of the cheque, [within thirty days] of the receipt of information by him from the bank regarding the return of the cheque as unpaid; and (c) the drawer of such cheque fails to make the payment of the said amount of money to the payee or, as the case", "page": 6}, {"source": "Dashrath Vs Hitesh SC Sec 56 NI Act Part Payment Cheque.pdf", "chunk_id": 0, "text": "7 may be, to the holder in due course of the cheque, within fifteen days of the receipt of the said notice.

Section 138 of the Act provides that a drawer of a cheque is deemed to have committed the offence if the following ingredients are fulfilled: (i) A cheque drawn for the payment of any amount of money to another person; (ii) The cheque is drawn for the discharge of the \u2018whole or part\u2019 of any debt or other liability. \u2018Debt or other liability\u2019 means legally enforceable debt or other liability; and (iii) The cheque is returned by the bank unpaid because of insufficient funds. However, unless the stipulations in the proviso are fulfilled the offence is not deemed to be committed. The conditions in the proviso are as follows: (i) The cheque must be presented in the bank within six months from the date on which it was drawn or within the period of its validity; (ii) The holder of the cheque must make a demand for the payment of the \u2018said amount of money\u2019 by giving a notice in writing to the drawer of the cheque within thirty days from the receipt of the notice from the bank that the cheque was returned dishonoured; and (iii) The holder of the cheque fails to make the payment of the \u2018said amount of money\u2019 within fifteen days from the receipt of the notice.", "page": 7}, {"source": "Dashrath Vs Hitesh SC Sec 56 NI Act Part Payment Cheque.pdf", "chunk_id": 1, "text": "the receipt of the notice.", "page": 7}, {"source": "Dashrath Vs Hitesh SC Sec 56 NI Act Part Payment Cheque.pdf", "chunk_id": 0, "text": "8 11. The primary contention of the first respondent is that the offence under Section 138 was not committed since the amount that was payable to the appellant, as on the date the cheque was presented for encashment, was less than the amount that was represented in the cheque. The question before this Court is whether Section 138 of the Act would still be attracted when the drawer of the cheque makes a part payment towards the debt or liability after the cheque is drawn but before the cheque is encashed, for the dishonour of the cheque which represents the full sum. 12. It must be noted that when a part-payment is made after the issuance of a post-dated cheque, the legally enforceable debt at the time of encashment is less than the sum represented in the cheque. A part-payment or a full payment may have been made between the date when the debt has accrued to the date when the cheque is sought to be encashed. Thus, it is crucial that we refer to the law laid down by this Court on the issuance of post-dated cheques and cheques issued for the purpose of security. In Indus Airways Private Limited v. Magnum Aviation Private Limited2, the issue before a two-Judge Bench of this Court was whether dishonour of post-dated cheques which were issued by the purchasers towards \u2018advance payment\u2019 would be covered by Section 138 of the Act if the purchase order was cancelled subsequently. It was held that Section 138 would only be applicable where there is a legally enforceable debt subsisting on the date when the cheque is drawn. In Sampelly Satyanarayana Rao v. Indian Renewable Energy Development Agency Limited3, the respondent advanced a loan for setting up a power project and post-dated cheques were given for", "page": 8}, {"source": "Dashrath Vs Hitesh SC Sec 56 NI Act Part Payment Cheque.pdf", "chunk_id": 1, "text": "Section 138 would only be applicable where there is a legally enforceable debt subsisting on the date when the cheque is drawn.

It was held that if the answer is in the affirmative, then the provisions of Section 138 would be attracted. In Sripati Singh v. State of Jharkand4, this Court observed that if a cheque is issued as security and if the debt is not repaid in any other form before the due date or if there is no understanding or agreement between the parties to defer the repayment, the cheque would mature for presentation: \u201c17. A cheque issued as security pursuant to a financial transaction cannot be considered as a worthless piece of paper under every circumstance. \u2018Security\u2019 in its true sense is the state of being safe and the security given for a loan is something given as a pledge of payment. It is given, deposited or pledged to make certain the fulfilment of an obligation to which the parties to the transaction are bound. If in a transaction, a loan is advanced and the borrower agrees to repay the amount in a specified timeframe and issues a cheque as security to secure such repayment; if the loan amount is not repaid in any other form before the due date or if there is no other understanding or agreement between the parties to defer the payment of amount, the cheque which is issued as security would mature for presentation and the drawee of the cheque would be entitled to present the same.

When a cheque is issued and is treated as \u2018security\u2019 towards repayment of an amount with a time period being stipulated for repayment, all that it ensures is that such cheque which is issued as \u2018security\u2019 cannot be presented prior to the loan or the instalment maturing for repayment towards which such cheque is issued as security. Further, the borrower would have the option of repaying the loan amount or such financial liability in any other form and in that manner if the amount of loan due and payable has been discharged 4 2021 SCC OnLine SC 1002", "page": 9}, {"source": "Dashrath Vs Hitesh SC Sec 56 NI Act Part Payment Cheque.pdf", "chunk_id": 0, "text": "10 within the agreed period, the cheque issued as security cannot thereafter be presented. Therefore, the prior discharge of the loan or there being an altered situation due to which there would be understanding between the parties is a sine qua non to not present the cheque which was issued as security. These are only the defences that would be available to the drawer of the cheque in a proceedings initiated under Section 138 of the N.I. Act. Therefore, there cannot be a hard and fast rule that a cheque which is issued as security can never be presented by the drawee of the cheque. If such is the understanding a cheque would also be reduced to an \u2018on demand promissory note\u2019 and in all circumstances, it would only be a civil litigation to recover the amount, which is not the intention of the statute. When a cheque is issued even though as \u2018security\u2019 the consequence flowing therefrom is also known to the drawer of the cheque and in the circumstance stated above if the cheque is presented and dishonoured, the holder of the cheque/drawee would have the option of initiating the civil proceedings for recovery or the criminal proceedings for punishment in the fact situation, but in any event, it is not for the drawer of the cheque to dictate terms with regard to the nature of litigation.\u201d (emphasis supplied) Based on the above analysis of precedent, the following principles emerge: (i) Where the borrower agrees to repay the loan within a specified timeline and issues a cheque for security but defaults in repaying the loan within the timeline, the cheque matures for presentation.

In Sunil Todi v. State of Gujarat5, a two judge Bench of this Court expounded the meaning of the phrase \u2018debt or other liability\u2019. It was observed that the phrase takes within its meaning a \u2018sum of money promised to be paid on a future day by reason of a present obligation\u2019. The court observed that a post-dated cheque issued after the debt was incurred would be covered within the meaning of \u2018debt\u2019. The court held that Section 138 would also include cases where the debt is incurred after the cheque is drawn but before it is presented for encashment. In this context, it was observed: \u201c26. The object of the NI Act is to enhance the acceptability of cheques and inculcate faith in the efficiency of negotiable instruments for transaction of business. The purpose of the provision would become otiose if the provision is interpreted to exclude cases where debt is incurred after the drawing of the cheque but before its encashment. In Indus Airways, advance payments were made but since the purchase agreement was cancelled, there was no occasion of incurring any debt. The true purpose of Section 138 would not be fulfilled, if \u2018debt or other liability\u2019 is interpreted to include only a debt that exists as on the date of drawing of the cheque. Moreover, Parliament has used the expression \u2018debt or other liability\u2019. The expression \u201cor other liability\u2019 must have a meaning of its own, the legislature having used two distinct phrases. The expression \u2018or other liability\u2019 has a content which is broader than \u2018a debt\u2019 and cannot be equated with the latter.

The judgments from Indus Airways (supra) to Sunil Todi (supra) indicate that much of the analysis on whether post-dated cheques issued as security would fall within the purview of Section 138 of the Act hinges on the relevance of time. In Indus Airways (supra), this Court held that for the commission of the offence under Section 138, there must have been a debt on the date of issuance of the cheque. However, later judgments adopt a more nuanced position while discussing the validity of proceedings under Section 138 on the dishonour of post-dated cheques. This Court since Sampelly Satyanarayana Rao (supra) has consistently held that there must be a legally enforceable debt on the date mentioned in the cheque, which is the date of maturity. 15. This Court in NEPC Micon Ltd. v. Magna Leasing Ltd.6 held that the Courts must interpret Section 138 with reference to the legislative intent to supress the mischief and advance the remedy. The objective of the Act in general and Section 138 specifically is to enhance the acceptability of cheques and to inculcate faith in the efficacy of negotiable instruments for the transaction of business.7 Section 138 criminalises the dishonour of cheques. This is in addition to the civil remedy that is available.

Therefore, cheques are issued and received as security with the contemplation that a part or the full sum that is addressed in the cheque may be paid before the cheque is encashed. 16. The judgments of this Court on post-dated cheques when read with the purpose of Section 138 indicate that an offence under the provision arises if the cheque represents a legally enforceable debt on the date of maturity. The offence under Section 138 is tipped by the dishonour of the cheque when it is sought to be encashed. Though a post- dated cheque might be drawn to represent a legally enforceable debt at the time of its drawing, for the offence to be attracted, the cheque must represent a legally enforceable debt at the time of encashment. If there has been a material change in the circumstance such that the sum in the cheque does not represent a legally enforceable debt at the time of maturity or encashment, then the offence under Section 138 is not made out. 17.

Proviso (b) to Section 138 states that a notice demanding the payment of the \u2018said amount of money\u2019 shall be made by the drawee of the cheque. 23. This Court has interpreted the phrase \u2018the said amount of money\u2019 as it finds place in proviso (b) to Section 138. In Suman Sethi v. Ajay K Churiwal10, the appellant issued a cheque for rupees twenty lakhs in favour of the first respondent. The cheque was dishonoured. A demand notice for an amount higher than the cheque amount was issued. A two-Judge Bench of this Court held that the demand has to be made for the \u2018said amount\u2019, which is the cheque amount. It was also observed that the question of whether the notice demanding an amount higher than the cheque amount is valid would depend on the language of the notice: \u201c8.

If in a notice while giving the break-up of the claim the cheque amount, interest, damages etc. are separately specified, other such claims for interest, cost etc. would be superfluous and these additional claims would be severable and will not invalidate the notice. If, however, in the notice an omnibus demand is made without specifying what was due under the dishonoured cheque, the notice might well fail to meet the legal requirement and may be regarded as bad.\u201d 24. In KR Indira v. G. Adinarayana11, it was held that the notice did not demand the payment of the cheque amount but the loan amount. It was observed that for the purposes of proviso (b), the amount covered in the dishonoured cheque must be demanded. In Rahul Builders (supra), the drawee demanded the payment of rupees 8,72,409 which was higher than the sum of rupees 1,00,000 represented in the cheque. It was reiterated that the phrase \u2018payment of the said amount\u2019 in proviso (b) would mean the cheque amount. Since the demand in the notice was not severable as the cheque amount could not be severed from the demand for the additional amount, it was held that it was an omnibus notice. Justice SB Sinha writing for a two-Judge Bench of this Court observed: \u201c10.

An omnibus notice without specifying as to what was the amount due under the dishonoured cheque would not subserve the requirement of law. Respondent 1 was not called upon to pay the amount which was payable under the cheque issued by it. The amount which it was called upon to pay was the outstanding amounts of bills i.e. Rs 8,72,409. The noticee was to respond to the said demand.

No demand was made upon it to pay the said sum of Rs 1,00,000 which was tendered to the complainant by cheque dated 30-4-2000. What was, therefore, demanded was the entire sum and not a part of it.\u201d 25. Section 138 creates a deeming offence. The provisos prescribe stipulations to safeguard the drawer of the cheque by providing them the opportunity of responding to the notice and an opportunity to repay the cheque amount. The conditions stipulated in the provisos need to be fulfilled in addition to the ingredients in the main provision of Section 138. It has already been concluded above that the offence under Section 138 arises only when a cheque that represents a part or whole of the legally enforceable debt at the time of encashment is returned by the bank unpaid. Since the cheque did not represent the legally enforceable debt at the time of encashment, the offence under Section 138 is not made out. 26. The appellant contends that the purpose of Section 138 of the Act would be defeated if the dishonour of the cheque issued for security is not included within the purview of Section 138 where the payment of a part of the cheque amount is made. It was contended that it would lead to a possibility where the drawer of the cheque could evade prosecution under Section 138 by paying a small amount of the debt while defaulting on the remaining payment. Section 56 stipulates that if there is an endorsement on a negotiable instrument that a part of the sum mentioned in the cheque has been paid, then the instrument may be negotiated for the balance.

A Division Bench of the Kerala High Court has held in Joseph Sartho v. Gopinathan12 that since the representation in the cheque was for a sum higher than the amount that was due on the date that it was presented for encashment, the drawer of the cheque cannot be convicted for the offence under Section 138 of the Act. The High Court of Delhi addressed the same issue in Alliance Infrastructure Project Ltd. v. Vinay Mittal13. The High Court observed that when part payment is made after the cheque is drawn, the payee has the option of either taking a new cheque for the reduced amount or by making an endorsement on the cheque acknowledging that a part payment was made according to the provisions of Section 56 of the Act. It was also held that the notice of demand which requires the drawer of the cheque to make payment of the whole amount represented in the cheque despite receiving part repayment against the sum, before the issue of notice, cannot be valid under Section 138(b) of the Act. A similar view was taken by the High Court of Gujarat in Shree Corporation v. Anilbhai Puranbhai Bansal14. 29.

When such an endorsement is made, the instrument could still be used to negotiate the balance amount. If the endorsed cheque when presented for encashment of the balance amount is dishonoured, then the drawee can take recourse to the provisions of Section 138. Thus, when a part- payment of the debt is made after the cheque was drawn but before the cheque is encashed, such payment must be endorsed on the cheque under Section 56 of the Act. The cheque cannot be presented for encashment without recording the part payment. If the unendorsed cheque is dishonoured on presentation, the offence under Section 138 would not be attracted since the cheque does not represent a legally enforceable debt at the time of encashment. 30. In view of the discussion above, we summarise our findings below: (i) For the commission of an offence under Section 138, the cheque that is dishonoured must represent a legally enforceable debt on the date of maturity or presentation; (ii) If the drawer of the cheque pays a part or whole of the sum between the period when the cheque is drawn and when it is encashed upon maturity, then the legally enforceable debt on the date of maturity would not be the sum represented on the cheque; (iii) When a part or whole of the sum represented on the cheque is paid by the drawer of the cheque, it must be endorsed on the cheque as prescribed in Section 56 of the Act.

Electricity Act, 2003 Sections 126, 135 and 145 Theft of electricity - Assessment of liability - Case was registered against plaintiff for theft of electricity wherein, plaintiff was acquitted of the charges by the Criminal Court - Question arises whether the jurisdiction of Civil Court is barred under Section 145 of Indian Electricity Act, in the cases where the demand of the Electricity Board/department is of the charges based on the alleged theft covered under Section 135 of the Act and further whether the consumer can be suggested the alternate remedy of appeal under Section 127 of the Act - Held, 1. In case the departments/officers/licensee/supplier is of the opinion that a consumer has committed theft as defined under the Act, and they/he initiate proceedings for theft under Section 135 of the Act, then the assessing officer has no authority to pass any order regarding assessment of liability and penalty against a consumer - If any such order of assessment/penalty is passed and purported to be enforced against a consumer by the department/licensee/supplier then the consumer has every right to avail the remedy of civil suit by challenging such order/demand raised by the department/licensee/supplier - In such a situation, the jurisdiction of the civil court shall not be barred by virtue of Section 145 of the Act; 2.

If an unauthorised order of assessment/penalty is passed by the department/licensee/supplier, despite having alleged and initiated proceedings of theft; then the consumer cannot be said to have alternative remedies under Section 127 of the Act - Therefore, he cannot be denied the right of filing the civil suit against such an illegal assessment/demand/penalty notice on the ground that he can avail an alternative remedy of appeal under Section 127 of the Act; 3. Since the Special Court cannot be initiated at the instance of the consumer and the civil liability as determined by the Special Courts has been restricted to be determined only 'against' the consumer and only for the loss/damages caused to the department and even without following the procedure of a civil court, therefore, mere existence of the Special Court does not, by implication, exclude the jurisdiction of the civil court, in a case where the assessing officer/licensee/supplier has passed an illegal or unauthorised order of demand despite having referred the matter to the police or the Special Court for determination of the same; Therefore, in the present case the order passed by the assessing officer imposing penalty upon the plaintiff was rightly challenged by the respondent before Civil Court - Civil Court has got the jurisdiction to try the matter - Decrees passed by Lower Appellate Court are upheld - Appeal dismissed.

JUDGMENT Mr. Rajbir Sehrawat, J. - The only question involved in this appeal for consideration by the Court is whether the jurisdiction of the Civil Court is barred under Section 145 of the Indian Electricity Act, in the cases where the demand of the electricity board/department is of the charges based on alleged theft covered under Section 135 of the Electricity Act and further whether the consumer can be suggested the alternate remedy of appeal under Section 127 of the Act in such a case. 2. The facts of this case are that the respondent herein had filed a suit for permanent and mandatory injunction to the effect that defendants be restrained from disconnecting the electricity supply of the meter installed in his premises and they be also restrained from recovering the impugned penalty of Rs. 1,49,200/-; which was imposed by defendant No. 1 (appellant herein) vide memo dated 27.01.2006. It was pleaded by the plaintiff/respondent herein that he was having a domestic electricity connection of Atta Chakki bearing no. M-18SP in his premises at village Matarsham Tehsil and District Hisar since 1982. On 15.01.2006 the above said electric meter got fire due to some electric fault/voltage fluctuation and the meter was burnt. The plaintiff's neighbour Nand Lal had seen the burning of the meter and informed the plaintiff about the same.

The plaintiff's neighbour Nand Lal had seen the burning of the meter and informed the plaintiff about the same. Number of persons from neighbourhood, even the Sarpanch and Panches of the village also gathered there. The plaintiff went to inform the lineman of the area along with his uncle to village Kurri. But the lineman was not available and then another line- man came to the village and he inspected the site and asked the plaintiff to report the matter to the J.E. of the Adampur area. Thereafter, the matter was reported to the said J.E.. On 16.01.2006 in the morning the J.E. had come and inspected the site and an application in writing was given on the same day which was entered in the complaint register of the defendants. Thereafter, the defendants asked the plaintiff to purchase a new meter and the new meter was purchased through a mediator tea vendor who was having a tea stall outside the office of the defendants. An amount of Rs. 2,100/- was charged from him and the new meter was sent to the laboratory for testing the same on 17.01.2006 itself. 3. It was further pleaded in the plaint that Kapoor Singh J.E. told the plaintiff that his connection was operating an Atta Chakki and therefore, the SDO, D.N. Khatkar, Avneet Singh and one Rai Sahab are demanding Rs. 25,000/- from the plaintiff and that if payment is not made by him to them then a case for theft of electricity would be registered against him.

The plaintiff requested the above said Kapoor Singh that he was not at fault when meter had been burnt. It was further pleaded that the above said D.N. Khatkar came to the village on 19.01.2006, threatened and demanded Rs. 25,000/- from the plaintiff. Plaintiff became terrified and paid Rs. 12,500/- to Kapoor Singh, J.E. On 19.01.2006, in the presence of Ram Pyara and Munshi Ram and after taking Rs. 12,500/- Kapoor Singh asked the plaintiff to visit Hisar office on 26.01.2006 and there the signature of the plaintiff was obtained on some printed papers. Thereafter, Kapoor Singh threatened that if the balance of Rs. 12,500/- is not paid then he would be helpless as the above said persons were demanding the full amount of bribe. The plaintiff expressed his inability to make more payment. Thereafter, a false report was prepared by the officials that M and P seal of meter were found missing and rivets found tampered. It was claimed by the plaintiff that neither meter was tampered nor seal was tampered by him. The meter was burnt-out due to the electricity supply/voltage fluctuation. On 28.01.2006, the plaintiff received a letter dated 27.01.2006 by which the penalty of Rs. 1,49,200/- had been imposed. 4. It was further pleaded that challenging this illegal demand the plaintiff had moved the District Consumer Dispute Redressal Forum, Hisar (for short, 'the Forum'). The Forum held the deficiency in service and negligence on the part of the defendants and the complaints were accepted and the checking report dated 19.01.2006 and the notice regarding penalty dated 27.01.2006 were quashed and the defendants were directed to restore the electricity supply of the Atta Chhaki in the premises", "page": 2}, {"source": "Dakshin Vs Jaswant Jaibir.pdf", "chunk_id": 3, "text": "held the deficiency in service and negligence on the part of the defendants and the complaints were accepted and the checking report dated 19.01.2006 and the notice regarding penalty dated 27.01.2006 were quashed and the defendants were directed to restore the electricity supply of the Atta Chhaki in the premises of the plaintiff.

Resultantly, the plaintiff had to come in civil suit challenging the illegal order of penalty and also seeking injunction against disconnection of the electricity supply. 5. In the mean time, a case of theft of electricity was registered against the plaintiff vide FIR No. 239/2006 at Police Station Sadar, Hisar. The plaintiff was granted anticipatory bail in the case. Thereafter, the plaintiff had also filed a criminal complaint against the above said D.N. Khatter and Kapoor Singh etc. on 08.04.2006. It is another thing that this complaint was later on dismissed by the Court. However, in the FIR case related to theft of electricity also the plaintiff was acquitted by the criminal court. 6. It was pleaded by the plaintiff in the suit that all the defendants, in connivance with each other, fabricated the story and the checking report dated 09.01.2006 and 22.01.2006 in order to pressurize the plaintiff to extort the money. Otherwise, there had been no theft of electricity in this case. 7. The respondents filed written statement in the case. It was alleged that the plaintiff was having a small category connection. However, he was using it for commercial purpose. It was further submitted in the written statement that plaintiff himself burnt the meter only to remove the evidence of breaking of the seals of the meter by him. 8. It was further claimed that the meter was checked on 19.01.2006 by Sh. D.N. Khattar, A.E.M&P, after receiving information on telephone from an unknown person, regarding the committing of theft of energy by the plaintiff. The said premises was found locked on 19.01.2006.

After checking, the plaintiff moved an application in the office of SDO, Operation, Sub Division Adampur, for changing the meter. M & P had desired that the said meter may be sent to M & T lab vide memo dated 24.01.2006. On 24.01.2006 the meter of the plaintiff was got checked in the lab in the presence of the plaintiff. During checking, all M & T seals of the meter were found missing and both the rivets were found tampered and meter block terminal of the meter was found burnt. Hence, it was claimed to be a clear case of theft of electricity. It was further claimed that a notice for compounding the offence was served upon the plaintiff vide memo dated 27.01.2006 under Sections 135, 138, 152 of the Indian Electricity Act whereby the answering defendant required the plaintiff to deposit a sum of Rs. 84,729/- for the loss caused to the Nigam and further required the plaintiff to deposit a sum of Rs. 1,49,200/- for compounding the offence. It was claimed that just to save his skin the plaintiff was levelling mischievous allegations. It was also claimed by the defendants/appellants herein that the Civil Court has got no jurisdiction to try the suit. 9. Parties led their respective evidence. 10.

Issue No. 3 framed by the learned Trial Court was regarding the jurisdiction to try and entertain the suit. However, as recorded by the learned Trial Court; the onus to prove this issue was on the defendants. But during the course of arguments learned counsel for the defendants had not pressed issues No. 2 to 5, which included issue No. 3 regarding jurisdiction. Learned Trial Court also held that simply because the plaintiff had been acquitted by the criminal court that does not bind the civil court against recording a finding against the plaintiff regarding theft of electricity in exercise of its civil jurisdiction. 11. Aggrieved by the judgment and decree passed by the learned Trial Court the plaintiff filed an appeal before the Additional District Judge, Hisar. The Additional District Judge, Hisar allowed the appeal filed by the plaintiff and ordered the suit of the plaintiff be decreed. The defendant Nigam was restrained from disconnecting the electricity supply to the plaintiff on the basis of impugned report and also restrained from effecting any recovery on the basis of impugned memo of penalty. Besides appreciating the evidence, the learned Appellate Court also recorded that when the meter of the plaintiff was not removed on 19.01.2006 because his premises was found locked and prior to joint checking report dated 24.01.2006 the plaintiff had made a report to the defendants Nigam that his meter has been burnt then on what basis the defendants were alleging that they had detected theft of electric energy at the premises of the plaintiff.

When the meter of the plaintiff was burnt before sending it to the lab then there could not have been a situation with the department to conclude, without noticing the accuracy of the meter, that the theft of the electricity was being committed by the plaintiff particularly so when in the checking report Ex:D-1 it is mentioned Page 3 of 15 Law Finder DocId # 948180 Licensed to: Sh.Naresh Garg,Advocate Bathinda Punjab 14-05-2023 Law Finder", "page": 3}, {"source": "Dakshin Vs Jaswant Jaibir.pdf", "chunk_id": 0, "text": "that a complaint was received by them about the meter of the plaintiff going burnt. Learned Appellate Court has also recorded that no other argument was urged before him. This also shows that the point regarding jurisdiction was also not raised before the learned Appellate Court. 12. Aggrieved by the judgment and decree passed by the learned Appellate Court, the defendants have come in appeal before this Court. Reason for the defendants to come in appeal appears to be the judgments of this Court holding that the civil court has no jurisdiction to try a case relating to theft of electricity. 13. While arguing the case, learned counsel for the appellants has restricted his argument only to the question that the civil court has no jurisdiction to try a case when notice of recovery of loss due to consumption or penalty is given by the department on account of theft of electricity by the consumer. To support his argument learned counsel for the appellants has relied upon the judgments of this Court reported in 2012(5) RCR (Civil) 64 titled as M/s Bharat Auto Care v. Punjab State Electricity Board and another, 2009(4) RCR (Civil) 199 reported as U.H.B.V.N., Panipat and others v.

A bare perusal of Sections 126, 127 and 135 of the Act show that Sections 126 and 127 of the Act deal with the unauthorized use of the electricity and constitute a complete court for passing the assessment orders in the case of unauthorized use of electricity.

M/s Sri Seetaram Rice Mill; 2012(3) Civil Court Cases 68 which is reproduced herein below:- 15. Upon their plain reading, the marked differences in the contents of Sections 126 and 135 of the 2003 Act are obvious. They are distinct and different provisions which operate in different fields and have no common premise in law. We have already noticed that Sections 126 and 127 of the 2003 Act read together constitute a complete code in themselves covering all relevant considerations for passing of an order of assessment in cases which do not fall under Section 135 of the 2003 Act. Section 135 of the 2003 Act falls under Part XIV relating to 'off fences and penalties' Section is of 'theft of electricity'. The Section opens with the words 'whoever, dishonestly' does any or all of the acts specified under clauses (a) to (e) of Sub-section (1) of Section 135 of the 2003 Act so as to abstract or consume or use electricity shall be punishable for imprisonment for a term which may extend to three years or with fine or with both. Besides imposition of punishment as specified under these provisions or the proviso thereto, Sub-section (1A) of Section 135 of the 2003 Act provides that without prejudice to the provisions of the 2003 Act, the licensee or supplier, as the case may be, through officer of rank authorized in this behalf by the appropriate commission, may immediately disconnect the supply of electricity and even take other measures enumerated under", "page": 8}, {"source": "Dakshin Vs Jaswant Jaibir.pdf", "chunk_id": 3, "text": "of the 2003 Act provides that without prejudice to the provisions of the 2003 Act, the licensee or supplier, as the case may be, through officer of rank authorized in this behalf by the appropriate commission, may immediately disconnect the supply of electricity and even take other measures enumerated under Sub-sections (2) to (4) of the said Section. The fine which may be imposed under Section 135 of the 2003 Act is directly proportional to the number of convictions and is also dependent on the extent of load abstracted. In contradistinction to these provisions, Section 126 of the 2003 Act would be applicable to the cases where there is no theft of electricity but the electricity is being consumed in violation of the terms and conditions of supply leading to malpractices Page 8 of 15 Law Finder DocId # 948180 Licensed to: Sh.Naresh Garg,Advocate Bathinda Punjab 14-05-2023 Law Finder", "page": 8}, {"source": "Dakshin Vs Jaswant Jaibir.pdf", "chunk_id": 0, "text": "which may squarely fall within the expression 'unauthorized use of electricity'. This assessment/proceedings would commence with the inspection of the premises by an assessing officer and recording of a finding that such consumer is indulging in an 'authorized use of electricity'. Then the assessing officer shall provisionally assess, to the best of his judgment, the electricity charges payable by such consumer, as well as pass a provisional assessment order in terms of Section 126(2) of the 2003 Act. The officer is also under obligation to serve a notice in terms of Section 126(3) of the 2003 Act upon any such consumer requiring him to file his objections, if any, against the provisional assessment before a final order of assessment is passed within thirty days from the date of service of such order of provisional assessment. Thereafter, any person served with the order of provisional assessment may accept such assessment and deposit the amount with the licensee within seven days of service of such provisional assessment order upon him or prefer an appeal against the resultant final order under Section 127 of the 2003 Act. The order of assessment under Section 126 and the period for which such order would be passed has to be in terms of Sub-sections (5) and (6) of Section 126 of the 2003 Act. The Explanation to Section 126 is of some significance, which we shell deal with shortly hereinafter. Section 126 of the 2003 Act falls under Chapter XII and relates to investigation and enforcement and empowers the assessing officer to pass an order of assessment. 16. Section 135 of the 2003 Act deals with an offence of theft of electricity and the penalty that can be imposed for such theft. This squarely falls within the dimensions of Criminal Jurisprudence and mens rea is one", "page": 9}, {"source": "Dakshin Vs Jaswant Jaibir.pdf", "chunk_id": 1, "text": "and empowers the assessing officer to pass an order of assessment. 16. Section 135 of the 2003 Act deals with an offence of theft of electricity and the penalty that can be imposed for such theft. This squarely falls within the dimensions of Criminal Jurisprudence and mens rea is one of the relevant factors for finding a case of theft. On the contrary, Section 126 of the 2003 Act does not speak of any criminal intendment and is primarily an action and remedy available under the civil law. It does not have features or elements which are traceable to the criminal concept of mens rea. 17. Thus, it would be clear that the expression 'unauthorized use of electricity' under Section 126 of the 2003 Act deals with cases of unauthorized use, even in absence of intention. These cases would certainly be different from cases where there is dishonest abstraction of electricity by any of the methods enlisted under Section 135 of the 2003 Act. A clear example would be, where a consumer has used excessive load as against the installed load simpliciter and there is violation of the terms and conditions of supply, then, the case would fall under Section 126 of the 2003 Act. On the other hand, where a consumer, by any of the means and methods as specified under Sections 135(a) to 135(e) of the 2003 Act, has abstracted energy with dishonest intention and without authorization, like providing for a direct connection bypassing the installed meter. Therefore, there is a clear distinction between the cases that would fall under Section 126 of the 2003 Act on the one hand and Section 135 of the 2003 Act on the other. There is no commonality between them in law. They operate in different and distinct fields. The assessing officer", "page": 9}, {"source": "Dakshin Vs Jaswant Jaibir.pdf", "chunk_id": 2, "text": "there is a clear distinction between the cases that would fall under Section 126 of the 2003 Act on the one hand and Section 135 of the 2003 Act on the other. There is no commonality between them in law. They operate in different and distinct fields. The assessing officer has been vested with the powers to pass provisional and final order of assessment in cases of unauthorized use of electricity and cases of consumption of electricity beyond contracted load will squarely fall under such power. The legislative intention is to cover the cases of malpractices and unauthorized use of electricity and then theft which is governed by the provisions of Section 135 of the 2003 Act. 18. Section 135 of the 2003 Act significantly uses the words 'whoever, dishonestly' does any of the listed actions so as to abstract or consume electricity would be punished in accordance with the provisions of the 2003 Act. 'Dishonesty' is a state of mind which has to be shown to exist before a person can be punished under the provisions of that Section.\" 16. Viewed in the light of the above said propositions expounded by the Hon'ble Supreme Court, it is clear that unauthorized use of electricity is altogether a different matter and has to be dealt with by assessing officer. That assessment has to be made by the assessing officers as to the amount to be charged from consumer. Such order passed by the assessing officer is appealable order. Hence the consumer can question such assessment in the remedies available to him under the Act and the rules framed thereunder. On the other hand, Section 135 of the Act defines the theft. For theft the consumer is required to be prosecuted for the offence of theft of electricity. The department is required", "page": 9}, {"source": "Dakshin Vs Jaswant Jaibir.pdf", "chunk_id": 3, "text": "can question such assessment in the remedies available to him under the Act and the rules framed thereunder. On the other hand, Section 135 of the Act defines the theft. For theft the consumer is required to be prosecuted for the offence of theft of electricity. The department is required to make a case of theft and report it to the police or to send it to the competent court of criminal jurisdiction as a complainant. It is for the competent court of criminal jurisdiction to see whether such person has committed theft of the electricity or not. There is no complication in the procedure so far mentioned. However, the problem arises when the officers of the department lodged the FIR for criminal prosecution and also passes an order of alleged assessment of liability of the consumer and serves a demand notice upon such consumer; asking him to deposit that amount on account of electricity consumed by him through the theft and/or as penalty. In this situation, the question Page 9 of 15 Law Finder DocId # 948180 Licensed to: Sh.Naresh Garg,Advocate Bathinda Punjab 14-05-2023 Law Finder", "page": 9}, {"source": "Dakshin Vs Jaswant Jaibir.pdf", "chunk_id": 0, "text": "is whether the assessing officer has any authority to decide the liability of consumer for electricity consumed through alleged theft and/or the penalty therefor. And if not then whether the consumer can be left remedy-less by denying him the jurisdiction of the civil court as per the provision of Section 145 of the Act. Second aspect is, can a consumer be asked to avail the remedy provided under Section 127 of the Act; even in the cases where the department alleges the theft of electricity and not the unauthorized use of the electricity as prescribed by Section 126 of the Act. 17. Learned counsel for the appellants has pointed out that Section 154 of the Act has provided for Special Court to deal with the matters of the theft of electricity. It is his argument that since Section 154(5) of the Act also provides for determining the 'civil liability' against the consumer, therefore, the jurisdiction of the civil court is barred and the Special Court constituted by Section 153 and 154 of the Act would be the sole competent authority to determine the civil issues between the parties. To support his argument he has relied upon the judgments mentioned above; rendered by this Court. 18. However, this Court does not find itself in agreement with the submission of learned counsel for the appellants. For the reasons mentioned in the following paragraphs, I fail to agree and beg to differ with my sister and brother Judges, holding in the above said cases that the jurisdiction of the civil court stands excluded by the provisions of Sections 145 and 154 of the Act. 19. A perusal of the judgment of U.H.B.V.N., Panipat and others (supra) shows that there is absolutely no discussion regarding the respective scope of Sections 126, 127 and 135", "page": 10}, {"source": "Dakshin Vs Jaswant Jaibir.pdf", "chunk_id": 1, "text": "cases that the jurisdiction of the civil court stands excluded by the provisions of Sections 145 and 154 of the Act. 19. A perusal of the judgment of U.H.B.V.N., Panipat and others (supra) shows that there is absolutely no discussion regarding the respective scope of Sections 126, 127 and 135 and other connected sections of the Act. On the basis of the bare language of Section 145 of the Act, the jurisdiction of the civil court has been held to be barred. Hence this judgment has not considered and decided the respective applicable sections of the Act. Therefore, it is of no help to the appellants as a precedent. In the case of M/s Bharat Auto Care(supra), the Court mentioned the provisions of the Act and while dealing with the scope of Section 145 of the Act, the Court relied upon the judgment of the Delhi High Court to the effect that although there is no specific provision in Section 145 of the Act for exclusion of the jurisdiction of the civil court to entertain any proceeding in respect of any matter which the Special Court is empowered by the Act to determine, however, in the view of Delhi High Court; the adjudication about the civil liability in theft cases was, impliedly, excluded from the jurisdiction of civil court; in view of the provision of Sections 153 and 154 of the Act, where a Special Court has been given jurisdiction to determine 'civil liability'. 20. In view of the above, the Court held that the impugned orders had been passed by the assessing officer by following procedure under Section 126 of the Act and therefore, civil court would have no jurisdiction before the plaintiff exhaust all remedies provided under Section 127 of the Act. Additionally, the Court also held that", "page": 10}, {"source": "Dakshin Vs Jaswant Jaibir.pdf", "chunk_id": 2, "text": "the Court held that the impugned orders had been passed by the assessing officer by following procedure under Section 126 of the Act and therefore, civil court would have no jurisdiction before the plaintiff exhaust all remedies provided under Section 127 of the Act. Additionally, the Court also held that the jurisdiction of the civil court would be barred in view of the provisions of Section 154(5) of the Act. The reasoning's given in the judgment are mutually destructive and contradicted each other. 21. In the next judgment of the Kapoor Singh's case(supra) the Court has held that the Special Court constituted under this Electricity Act has a dual responsibility to examine the case, from both the angles, one of theft and one of civil liability and to pass orders accordingly. In effect, the reliance of the Court in this case was also upon the fact that Special Court had been constituted to try the matters relating to theft of electricity and therefore, the jurisdiction of the civil court stands excluded. However, this judgment does not deal with the issue as to whether the assessing officer can pass order of liability against the consumer even in a case of alleged theft and if at all such order is passed, how that order could be questioned by the effected consumer. 22. Lastly, in the judgment in Darshan Singh's case(supra) the Court took a little bit different view and held that although Section 154 of the Act does not strictly deal with any situation for enabling the consumer to challenge the order passed by departmental officers for recovery on account of theft whereas Section 145 of the Act barred jurisdiction of civil court. Finding that the consumer cannot be left remedy-less, the Court held that even in cases of theft of electricity", "page": 10}, {"source": "Dakshin Vs Jaswant Jaibir.pdf", "chunk_id": 3, "text": "any situation for enabling the consumer to challenge the order passed by departmental officers for recovery on account of theft whereas Section 145 of the Act barred jurisdiction of civil court. Finding that the consumer cannot be left remedy-less, the Court held that even in cases of theft of electricity under Section 135 of the Act, the consumer can file an appeal under Section 127 of the Act and that such appeal would not be without jurisdiction. However in this case the question regarding exclusion of the jurisdiction of the civil court was not strictly decided by the Court. Still further, the interpretation given in this case runs against even the bare provision of Section 154 of the Act; which gives power to decide the 'civil liability' to the Special Court. 23. The Code of Civil Procedure (for short, 'CPC') gives the planner power and jurisdiction to civil court to try all kind of suits of civil nature except specifically barred under some other Page 10 of 15 Law Finder DocId # 948180 Licensed to: Sh.Naresh Garg,Advocate Bathinda Punjab 14-05-2023 Law Finder", "page": 10}, {"source": "Dakshin Vs Jaswant Jaibir.pdf", "chunk_id": 0, "text": "statutory provision of law. The relevant provision of CPC as contained in Section 9 is reproduced herein below:- 9. Courts to try all civil suits unless barred .- The Courts shall (subject to the provisions herein contained) have jurisdiction to try all Suits of a civil nature excepting suits of which their cognizance is either expressly or impliedly barred. Explanation 1.-As suit in which the right to property or to an office is contested is a suit of a civil nature, notwithstanding that such right may depend entirely on the decision of questions as to religious rites or ceremonies. Explanation II-For the purposes of this section, it is immaterial whether or not any fees are attached to the office referred to in Explanation I or whether or not such office is attached to a particular place. 24. A bare perusal of this provision shows that the civil court has jurisdiction to try all disputes relating to property, office or even other matters which affect civil rights of citizen. The jurisdiction of the civil court can only be barred by making another provision of statutory law which; expressly or by necessary implication; takes away the jurisdiction of the civil courts. 25. However, before proceeding further it is necessary to be reminded that while considering the question of exclusion of the jurisdiction of civil court it has to be kept in mind that presumption would be in favour of the existence of the jurisdiction of civil court; so far as the civil matters are concerned. Secondly, while interpreting a provision excluding the jurisdiction of the civil court; such provision has to be given restrictive interpretation so as to retain the jurisdiction of the civil court in determination of civil rights of the citizens. Therefore, the Courts are not supposed to interpolate words", "page": 11}, {"source": "Dakshin Vs Jaswant Jaibir.pdf", "chunk_id": 1, "text": "matters are concerned. Secondly, while interpreting a provision excluding the jurisdiction of the civil court; such provision has to be given restrictive interpretation so as to retain the jurisdiction of the civil court in determination of civil rights of the citizens. Therefore, the Courts are not supposed to interpolate words and phrases into that provision which purportedly excludes the jurisdiction of the civil court. The provision has to be read as it is and to be given a literal meaning, of course, while reading the statute as a whole. Lastly, if the jurisdiction of the civil court is specifically excluded in particular matter, by name, then such provision excluding the jurisdiction of the civil court has to be given primacy. 26. Keeping in view the above principles, if one is to analyse the provision of Section 145 of the Act it is clear that the jurisdiction of the civil court has been barred in respect of the matters regarding which the 'Assessing Officer' have the jurisdiction under Section 126 of the Act or the 'Appellate Authority' has the jurisdiction to decide the appeal under Section 127 of the Act. Still further, this provision excludes the jurisdiction in the matters regarding which the 'Adjudicating Officer' appointed under this Act is empowered to determine. Section 143 of the Act defines the powers of the adjudicating officer appointed by the appropriate Commission to deal with the matters reserved for the determination of adjudicating officers. Hence, it is clear so far as the bare language of Section 145 of the Act is concerned, it bars the jurisdiction of the civil court only in those matters where the assessing officer has the power to assess under Section 126 of the Act, the Appellate Authority has power to hear the appeal under Section 127 of the", "page": 11}, {"source": "Dakshin Vs Jaswant Jaibir.pdf", "chunk_id": 2, "text": "language of Section 145 of the Act is concerned, it bars the jurisdiction of the civil court only in those matters where the assessing officer has the power to assess under Section 126 of the Act, the Appellate Authority has power to hear the appeal under Section 127 of the Act or the adjudicating officer has the power to adjudicate upon under Section 143 of the Act. There is no fourth aspect regarding which the jurisdiction of the civil court is expressly barred by the provision of the Act. Section 145 of the Act does not prescribe that the jurisdiction of civil court shall be excluded regarding those matters; regarding which the Special Court constituted under Sections 153 and 154 of the Act are empowered to decide. Therefore, regarding any matter, which the Special Courts constituted under the provisions of this Act are to decide; the jurisdiction of the civil court is not 'expressly' barred by provision of Section 145 of the Act. Hence mere fact that the Special Courts have been constituted under Sections 153 and 154 of the Act, per se, is not the ground for exclusion of the jurisdiction of the civil court in itself. 27. The next aspect of the matter is whether by any necessary 'implication'; the provision for Special Court and the powers conferred upon them, or the decision taken by the Special Court exclude the jurisdiction of the civil court? 28. A bare perusal of the provisions contained in the Act shows that in case of allegations of theft, reporting of the theft by officer, licensee or supplier to the police or to the Court, compounding of offence of theft and in case of non-compounding/contest of the offence by the consumer, the determination of offence of theft and the punishment therefore, is contained", "page": 11}, {"source": "Dakshin Vs Jaswant Jaibir.pdf", "chunk_id": 3, "text": "in case of allegations of theft, reporting of the theft by officer, licensee or supplier to the police or to the Court, compounding of offence of theft and in case of non-compounding/contest of the offence by the consumer, the determination of offence of theft and the punishment therefore, is contained in altogether a different part and chapter of the Act; which deals with the offence and penalties only. Although certain factors; as mentioned in Section 126 of the Act; defining the unauthorised use, and Section 135 of the Act defining the theft are over-lapping, however, the element of mens rea is an essential condition for allegation of theft as defined under Section 135 of the Act. And if mens rea is not there then the matter would fall under Section 126 of the Page 11 of 15 Law Finder DocId # 948180 Licensed to: Sh.Naresh Garg,Advocate Bathinda Punjab 14-05-2023 Law Finder", "page": 11}, {"source": "Dakshin Vs Jaswant Jaibir.pdf", "chunk_id": 0, "text": "Act; even regarding those aspects which are overlapping in these two provisions. This position has already been explained by the Hon'ble Supreme Court. Hence it is clear that if the officers of the respondents/licensee/supplier are of the opinion that there is no mens rea or the intention to deceive, then they would proceed in the matter of assessing the amount to be charged from the consumer and then provision of Sections 126 & 127 of the Act would be followed; resulting into exclusion of jurisdiction of civil court under Section 145 of the Act. 29. However, if they are of the prima facie view that; even in those matters where factors mentioned in Sections 126 and 135 are overlapping or, on the factors which are exclusively mentioned in Section 135 of the Act, the consumer has had a deceitful intention to extract the electrical energy; then they would be required to make a complaint either to the police or to the Court constituted under this Chapter. If the assessing officer/authorised officer takes a prima facie view that there is theft involved in the matter then the assessing officer would; simply have no jurisdiction to assess the amount of loss on account of theft or the penalty at his own level. The element of mens rea being a sine qua non for the purpose of theft; the matter would be exclusively dealt with by the chapter pertaining to offences and penalties. Giving any power to assessing officer to make an order of assessment, even in those cases where the theft is claimed by the assessing officer/authorised officer on behalf of the consumer; would tantamount to give a preemptive power/authority to the assessing officer over the Special Courts constituted under the chapters dealing with the offences and penalties.

This cannot be the policy of law and this cannot be the philosophy of law. Once the matter is expressly given in the domain of the Special Court then any assessing officer/authorised officer cannot be permitted to preempt or to tinker with or in any manner prejudice the jurisdiction of the Special Court constituted under the Act. Hence, it is clear that once the theft is alleged by the department or licensee or supplier then the assessing officer/authorised officer cannot pass any order against the consumer demanding any specific amount, since in that situation the liability against consumer is to be determined by Special Court. Hence, the question would be if still assessing officer/authorised officer passes any order of assessment/penalties/demand against the consumer then where and what would be the remedy available to such a consumer. While finding answer to this question, it has to be kept in mind that the Court is a Court whether the party before it is the consumer or be it the electricity department/licensee/supplier. Therefore, while considering the question whether the Special Courts constituted under the Act; by implication; exclude the jurisdiction of civil court, it has to be seen whether both the sides have been given equal remedies and opportunities under the provisions of the Act to raise and get their claim adjudicated upon before the Special Courts and get it adjudicate as per the principles meant for civil adjudication. 30.

So far as the claim of the electricity department/licensee/supplier in case of theft is concerned, the same has been taken care of by Part XIV of the Act, which deals with the offences and penalties. Chapter 135 of the Act defines theft and authorizes the authorities/officers of the department/licensee/supplier to make report to the investigating agency or to the Court; in case they are prima facie of the view that the consumer has committed theft. To adjudicate upon this complaint of the department/licensee/supplier; Chapter XV of the Act provides a special forum by virtue of Constitution of Special Courts. The Special Court is authorised to determine the guilt of consumer regarding allegation of theft, punish him and also to compensate the department for loss on account of theft of electricity by determining the 'civil liability' 'against' the consumer on a liquidated scale provided under the Act. 31. At this stage, question is as to what remedy the consumer has got against the illegal and unauthorized demand raised by the department? Does the provision of Section 153 of the Act which provides for constitution of Special Court, bars the jurisdiction of Civil Court? Does the power conferred upon Special Court under Section 154 of the Act provides for civil adjudication, provide remedy to the consumer against illegal demands forced by the department upon him and, therefore, by implication, exclude the jurisdiction of civil court?

Section 153(1) of the Act makes it clear that the Special Courts constitute under the Act have been created only to adjudicate upon the offences referred to in Sections 135 to 140 and Section 150 of the Act; as specifically mentioned in the Act. Therefore, matters where the assessing officer claims to be authorised to pass the order under Section 126 of the Act and the matters claimed to be covered under Section 143 of the Act where the adjudicating officer is authorised to adjudicate upon a matter, do not fall in the scope of the Special Court constituted under Section 153 of the Act. Hence, the provision of Section 153(1) of the Act do not provide for exclusion of the jurisdiction of the civil court, regarding the matters where the alleged order of assessment or penalty is passed by assessing officer claiming though wrongly, his authority to pass such order under Section 126 of the Act.

From the provision of Section 154 of the Act, it is clear that it does not provide any remedy to the consumer to institute his claim against the department nor does it provide for any mechanism of civil adjudication as per the principles of civil adjudication of a matter. Section 154 of the Act which defines the powers of the Special Court restrict it to the matters covered under Sections 135 to 140 and Section 150 of the Act. This section confers upon the Special Courts only the powers of a Sessions Court and uses a non obstinate clause only against the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 (for short, 'Cr.P.C.') and not against the Code of Civil Procedure (for short, 'CPC'). Hence, the application of CPC, in the matters relating to other than the offences defined under Sections 135 to 140 and Section 150 of the Act, is not excluded by Section 154 of the Act. Meaning thereby that beyond the determination of the alleged guilt of the person, the accused can very well avail his civil remedies under CPC if his claim is other than the offence specified by above-said Sections. Still further a bare perusal of Section 155 of the Act shows that the Special Court shall be deemed to be a Court of Session and shall have all the powers of the Court of Session. Still further it prescribes that the person conducting the prosecution before the Special Court shall be deemed to be public prosecutor. Still further, Section 156 of the Act, which provides for appeal and revisions, also prescribes that High Court may exercise powers against the order of the Special Court as conferred upon it under the Cr.P.C. from an order of the Court of Session.

Hence by any stretch of imagination, neither the Special Courts constituted under the Act are the civil courts nor do these courts determine the civil rights of the parties. These courts are meant, exclusively, to try an accused and to inflict punishment upon such an accused in accordance with the provisions of this Act. 33. A bare perusal of the provisions and scheme of the Act makes it clear that in case the assessing officer sends to a consumer a demand notice for assessed amount and/or penalty and also alleging theft at the same time then the consumer has no remedy to challenge that demand/assessment, although such demand/assessment done by the assessing officer is totally without authority and jurisdiction. The Special Courts are unilateral forums available to the departments/licensee/supplier to get the consumer prosecuted. These courts cannot grant any decree 'in favour' of the consumer under any circumstances. So far as the prospective; from the point of view of the consumer is concerned, Special Courts have very limited mandate of trying the consumer for the offences specified in the Act and to inflict the punishment upon the consumer.

Even if the order passed by the officers/licensee/supplier is totally illegal, the consumer has not been given any remedy of initiating proceedings for challenging such order under any provision relating to Special Courts as constituted under the Act. Nor have the Special Courts, as constituted under this Act, been given power to entertain any pleading initiated by the consumer against an order which he might perceive to be violative of its civil rights. Hence, by any means, the creation of Special Courts, the jurisdiction conferred upon the Special Courts or scope of their authority do not comprehend the determination of a claim of the consumer; as initiated by the consumer and from the point of view of the consumer. Under the provisions of the Constitution of the said Special Courts; the consumer has been totally pushed in the criminal jurisdiction; at the mercy of initiation of the proceedings by the officers/licensee/supplier and a determination thereof as per the case presented by the prosecuting agency/officer of the department/licensee/supplier. He has no alternative under the provisions of this Act but to await the decision of his fate in a manner as presented and prosecuted by the department and as decided by the criminal court. 34. Much stress has been laid upon the provision of Section 154(5) of the Act to argue that the Special Court has been given power to determine the 'civil liability' against the consumer or a person; in terms of money for the theft of energy, therefore, the provision of Section 145 of the Act shall have to be read as excluding the jurisdiction of the civil court by implication and interpretation of Section 154", "page": 13}, {"source": "Dakshin Vs Jaswant Jaibir.pdf", "chunk_id": 3, "text": "power to determine the 'civil liability' against the consumer or a person; in terms of money for the theft of energy, therefore, the provision of Section 145 of the Act shall have to be read as excluding the jurisdiction of the civil court by implication and interpretation of Section 154 of the Act. However, there is a basic fallacy in the argument. Even the bare perusal of this provision shows that the Special Court can determine the civil liability only 'against' the consumer. It does not have any power to determine the civil liability 'in favour' of the consumer. The reason for enacting this provision for fixing the 'civil liability' 'against' the consumer is that; this sub-section is required to be invoked only after a person has been convicted of an offence of theft. Therefore, the 'civil liability' as contemplated under Section 154(5) of the Act is in the nature of additional punishment in terms of money required to be paid to the department, besides the punishment of imprisonment and fine as otherwise provided in the Act. The fact that this determination of civil liability is by way of 'punishment' is also reflected by the fact that it has been provided by way of 'minimum' \"monetary\" punishment. The Special Court is not authorised to determine the 'civil liability' which is not less than or equivalent of amount which is 'two times of the tariff' for the period of theft. Had it been conceived by the Act as the 'civil liability', as contemplated in civil jurisdiction then there would not have been any question of fixing minimum liability and even that only against one Page 13 of 15 Law Finder DocId # 948180 Licensed to: Sh.Naresh Garg,Advocate Bathinda Punjab 14-05-2023 Law Finder", "page": 13}, {"source": "Dakshin Vs Jaswant Jaibir.pdf", "chunk_id": 4, "text": "as contemplated in civil jurisdiction then there would not have been any question of fixing minimum liability and even that only against one Page 13 of 15 Law Finder DocId # 948180 Licensed to: Sh.Naresh Garg,Advocate Bathinda Punjab 14-05-2023 Law Finder", "page": 13}, {"source": "Dakshin Vs Jaswant Jaibir.pdf", "chunk_id": 0, "text": "of the party to the litigation.

But the bare fact that neither the civil procedure has been followed in determining the said 'civil liability' nor the same is determined by a civil court, such determination of 'civil liability' cannot be treated to be a final determination of liability of consumer nor has it been declared by the Act to be the final determination against consumer. Such determination of 'civil liability' and creation of a deeming fiction of the same as a 'decree' is limited to enabling the department/licensee/supplier to recover this amount through the means through which a decree is executed. However, this fact itself does not debar a consumer from challenging his liability so determined, even by the Special Court; before a civil court by insisting upon following the civil procedure prescribed by CPC for the citizens of the country and as per the standard of proof applicable in civil law saying otherwise would be violative of Fundamental right of that citizen guaranteed by Article 14 of the Constitution of India.

Mere fact that order of criminal court has been given a colour or deemed status of decree of civil court does not alter this settled proposition of law. For an order of a Court to have full effect of being a civil decree, the essence is the determination of the same through civil procedure and as per the principles of civil law. Any determination through criminal law cannot have the full effect of or exclude the determination through civil law for the simple reason that in criminal determination one of the parties, i.e., the accused is always under threat of punishment, he cannot even raise all his pleas for the fear of prejudice to his defence against prosecution and has a right; even to remain silent. Hence a determination through criminal procedure cannot exclude determination through civil procedure. After all a citizen cannot be forced to be subjected to legal asphyxia. 35. Hence, from the above facts, it is clear that in case of a illegal demand raised by unauthorised officer of the department/licensee/supplier the consumer has not been given any remedy under the Act. Although, the Special Court has been constituted for trying the offence of theft and to determine the loss caused to the department by way of 'civil liability' of the accused/convict, however, the Special Courts are not given any powers of civil court.

The power conferred upon the Special Courts are not the powers conferred upon civil courts and the scope of adjudication as contemplated under the Act; is not the scope, which is of a vide spectrum in case of jurisdiction of a civil court. Hence it has to be held that the constitution of Special Court, the powers conferred upon it or the scope of the matters to be dealt with by these courts do not grant remedy to the consumer to raise civil disputes and get the same adjudicated through civil procedure or 'in his favour'. The Special Courts constituted under Section 153 of the Act are meant only to try the offences mentioned under Sections 135 to 140 and Section 150 of the Act. Since the scope of the Special Courts is not encompassing into itself the remedies and determination of civil rights of the consumer; which may arise from the illegal and unathourised orders passed or action taken by the assessing officer or adjudicating officers beyond the scope of their powers, hence, it has to be held that, even by implication, the jurisdiction of the civil court is not excluded/barred, as contemplated under Section 145 of the Act, simply for the reasons of constitution of the Special Courts under the Act. 36. The next question to be considered in this case is whether the jurisdiction of the civil court can be just side tracked by the courts by suggesting to the litigant an alternative method or alternative remedies of appeal supposedly provided by the Act? The answer to this question has to be in negative; in view of the", "page": 14}, {"source": "Dakshin Vs Jaswant Jaibir.pdf", "chunk_id": 3, "text": "this case is whether the jurisdiction of the civil court can be just side tracked by the courts by suggesting to the litigant an alternative method or alternative remedies of appeal supposedly provided by the Act? The answer to this question has to be in negative; in view of the provision of section 9 of CPC which gives a planner power to the civil courts to try any suit and also provisions of Order 1 Rule I of CPC gives a right to any person to bring a civil suit if he perceives, as aggrieved of any action of the officer or any other person, as violating his civil rights. Otherwise also, the provision of Section 126 of the Act shows that under this provision it is the \"best assessment judgment\" of the assessing officer; which shall be the basis for adjudication and decision, if an appeal is taken under Section 127 of the Act. Even the period and rate of assessment has been bound down by the provisions of the Act itself. Hence, if a consumer is to take remedy of appeal against the unauthorized orders of the assessing officer the challenge would be restricted in its scope and entitlements. Such restricted scope of rights and adjudication is not a substitute for the planner determination to which a citizen shall be entitled to, if he brings an independent suit before a civil court. Hence simply because a consumer can be suggested to avail remedy of appeal under Section 127 of the Act, against an otherwise unauthorised, order, is no ground to hold that he cannot avail the remedy of civil suit by invoking civil jurisdiction of a civil court.

Hence, in a case which does not strictly fall in the scope of Sections 126 and 127 of the Act, as in case of allegation of theft, a consumer/citizen cannot be denied his right to avail the remedy of civil suit before a civil court by suggesting him an alternative remedy of an appeal under Section 127 of the Act. 37. In view of the above, the answers to the questions posed in the beginning in this case have to be as follows:- (1) in case the departments/officers/licensee/supplier is of the opinion that a consumer has committed theft as defined under the Act, and they/he initiate proceedings for theft under Section 135 of the Act, then the assessing officer has no authority to pass any order regarding assessment of liability and penalty against a consumer. If any such order of assessment/penalty is passed and purported to be enforced against a consumer by the department/licensee/supplier then the consumer has every right to avail the remedy of civil suit by challenging such order/demand raised by the department/licensee/supplier.

In such a situation, the jurisdiction of the civil court shall not be barred by virtue of Section 145 of the Act. (2) If an unauthorised order of assessment/penalty is passed by the department/licensee/supplier, despite having alleged and initiated proceedings of theft; then the consumer cannot be said to have alternative remedies under Section 127 of the Act. Therefore, he cannot be denied the right of filing the civil suit against such an illegal assessment/demand/penalty notice on the ground that he can avail an alternative remedy of appeal under Section 127 of the Act. (3) Since the Special Court cannot be initiated at the instance of the consumer and the civil liability as determined by the Special Courts has been restricted to be determined only 'against' the consumer and only for the loss/damages caused to the department and even without following the procedure of a civil court, therefore, mere existence of the Special Court does not, by implication, exclude the jurisdiction of the civil court, in a case where the assessing officer/licensee/supplier has passed an illegal or unauthorised order of demand despite having referred the matter to the police or the Special Court for determination of the same. 38. In view of the above, in the present case the order passed by the assessing officer, imposing penalty of Rs. 1,49,200/- upon the plaintiff, was rightly challenged by the respondent before the Civil Court.

Since it is barred by limitation, C.M. No. 12288-C of 2009 has been moved for condonation of 107 days' delay in its filing. 2. The respondent had filed a suit disputing the penalty of Rs. 6,17,677/- imposed upon it on the ground that meter installed in its premises was checked and was found to be running slow. The penalty was questioned by alleging that the inspection was not carried out by the appellants by any technical instrument on 17.11.2000 and no show cause notice was served upon it and that the copy of the inspection report was never supplied to it. The respondent had also alleged that the inspection report was never got signed from any of its authorised officer. It was pleaded that in fact, no inspection had taken place on 17.11.2000 as the meter had been changed in December,2000 and if it was running slow, then the appellants would have removed the meter on the same day itself. 3. The appellants contested the suit and defended their action in carrying out the inspection and also defended the imposition of penalty which was stated to be in accordance with law. The parties went to trial on the following issues:- 1. Whether the memo No.1165 dated 4.12.2000 to the tune of Rs. 6,17,677/- is illegal and not binding on the rights of the plaintiff?OPP This judgement ranked 1 in the hitlist.

Both the Courts concluded that the appellants had failed to follow the procedure which was enshrined in Sections 24 and 26 of the Indian Electricity Act (for short, 'the Act') before imposing the penalty upon the respondent. It was held that the procedure for carrying out the inspection was also not adhered to. The suit was accordingly decreed and the appeal of the appellants was dismissed. 5. Hence, this appeal. 6. After hearing the learned counsel for the appellants and perusing the impugned judgments, I am of the opinion that there is no infirmity therein. The appellants had failed to establish before the Courts below that the principles of natural justice had been complied with by issuance of a proper show cause notice to the respondent and that it had been made aware of the checking report which ought to have been got signed from its authorised representatives. The signatures which appeared on the notice were not traced out to be any of the employees of the respondent. The report was also not put to the witnesses of the respondent. These two factors when evaluated in the light of the testimony of DW1- Shri R.K. Sehgal and DW2-D.N. Chaudhary shows that the respondent was never confronted with the report nor was it signed by any authorised representative of the respondent, even though it was admitted that senior officer of the respondent was present. It is not the case of the appellants that this senior officer of the respondent, who was present, had refused to sign the report, although the testimony of DW1 and DW2 further qualifies to say that", "page": 2}, {"source": "Dakshin Haryana Vs Nestor.pdf", "chunk_id": 1, "text": "respondent, even though it was admitted that senior officer of the respondent was present. It is not the case of the appellants that this senior officer of the respondent, who was present, had refused to sign the report, although the testimony of DW1 and DW2 further qualifies to say that when the said senior officer, Shri R.K. Khattar, was asked to sign, he further asked their Electrician,namely, Shri Krishan, to sign. It was imperative for the appellants to have mentioned this fact in the report or to have traced the signatures by establishing that the person, who had signed the report, was the employee of the respondent. 7. Besides, the provisions of Section 26(6) of the Act have also been violated. According to this section, if there was a dispute regarding the meter, the matter was to be decided upon an application of either of the parties by the Electrical Inspector. His report was essentially to determine the extent of the amount of energy supplied to the consumer to ascertain the liability. Concededly, that has not been done and consequently, the findings of the Courts below cannot be faulted with. 8. That apart, the appeal has been filed with a delay of 107 days which has not been satisfactorily explained. 9. Consequently, the appeal is dismissed on merits, as also being barred by limitation. C.M. No. 12289-C of 2009 which has been filed for staying the execution of the impugned judgments, is also dismissed in view of the above. .

Delhi Transport Corporation, (2009) 6 SCC 121 JUDGMENT Sudhanshu Dhulia, J. - Leave granted. 2. By way of the present appeals, the Appellants challenge the common judgement and order of the Rajasthan High Court at Jaipur passed on 14.05.2018 whereby High Court reduced the compensation payable to Appellant No. 1 and dismissed the claim in so far as it relates Appellant No. 2 in a case arising out of a claim petition filed under the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988. 3. Brief facts giving rise to these appeals are that on 26.01.2008 at around 1:15 pm, the deceased, namely, Smt. Paras Sharma was on her two-wheeler and when she reached a road crossing where a Roadways bus (\"offending vehicle\") stopped to her left and the negligently took a sudden right turn due to which the deceased came under the rear right-side tyre of the offending vehicle and succumbed to her injuries. 4. A claim petition was filed by the Appellants, who are the married daughter of the deceased (\"Appellant No. 1\") and mother of the deceased (\"Appellant No. 2\"), respectively, seeking compensation of Rs. 54,30,740/-. 5. The Tribunal vide order dated 11.05.2011, however, only allowed the claim petition to the extent of Rs. 15,97,000/- with 6% interest from the date of filing the claim petition and in default of payment within 30 days and had observed that 9% interest shall be payable to the Appellants, holding the driver of the offending vehicle (\"Respondent No. 2\"), the owner of the offending vehicle (\"Respondent No. 3\") and the insurer of the offending vehicle (\"Respondent No. 1\"), jointly and severally liable.

The Tribunal assessed the age of the deceased to be between 50 and 55 years and determined her monthly income to be Rs. 24,406/-. It held that the Appellants were the legal heirs of the deceased and were to some extent dependent on her, presuming 50% dependency. Accordingly, applying a multiplier of 11, the Tribunal computed the loss of income at Rs. 15,84,000/-. In addition, it awarded Rs. 5,000/- to Appellant No. 1 under the head of loss of love and affection, and Rs. 5,000/- to Appellant No. 2 for loss of care and services of the deceased. A further sum of Rs. 3,000/- was granted towards funeral expenses. 6. The Claimants-Appellants and Respondent No.1 - Insurance Company preferred separate appeals before the High Court. The Claimants-Appellants were aggrieved by the amount of compensation awarded, seeking enhancement of the same. On the other hand, Respondent No. 1 was aggrieved by the award to Appellant No.1 i.e. the daughter of the deceased, on the ground that she was entitled to lesser compensation in light of Section 140 of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988. Insofar as Appellant No.2 i.e. the mother of the deceased is concerned, Respondent No. 1 argued that she is not entitled to any compensation whatsoever because she cannot be considered a legal heir of the deceased. 7. The High Court vide common impugned judgement dismissed the appeal filed by the Claimant- Appellants and partly allowed the appeal filed by the Respondent No.1.

Now the Appellants are before us challenging the impugned order and judgement of the High Court on the grounds that the High Court has misinterpreted this Court's judgement in Manjuri Bera. 9. We have heard all the parties and perused the material on record. 10. It is not disputed that the death of the deceased was caused due to the rash and negligent driving of Respondent No. 2 who was driving the offending vehicle owned by Respondent No. 3 which was insured by Respondent No. 1. 11. The only question before us is whether the Appellants are entitled to compensation as awarded by the Tribunal on account of being dependent on the deceased. 12. The Appellants claim that they were entirely dependent on the deceased. The deceased was married but her husband had left her soon after the birth of Appellant No. 1 (her daughter), after which Appellant No. 2 (her mother) was living with the deceased daughter. 13. Once a daughter is married, logical presumption is that she now has rights on her matrimonial household and is also financially supported by her husband or his family, unless proven otherwise. It is more than likely that her dependence on her natal family, including her mother has now ceased. Sections 166 and 168 of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988 focus on the financial relationship between the deceased and the Claimant. A married daughter may be considered a legal representative, as per Manjuri Bera, but she will not be eligible for loss of dependency compensation unless it is proven by the daughter that she was financially dependent on the deceased. Thus, it is clear from the record that Appellant No. 1 has failed to prove that she was being financially supported by her mother post marriage and hence", "page": 3}, {"source": "Deep Shikha v.

Thus, it is clear from the record that Appellant No. 1 has failed to prove that she was being financially supported by her mother post marriage and hence cannot be said to be a dependent of her mother, the deceased. 14. Therefore, it is our opinion the High Court correctly relied on Manjuri Bera while holding that Appellant No.1, as the legal representative of the deceased, will only be entitled to compensation envisaged in Section 140 of the Motor Vehicle Act, 1988 as liability under the same does not cease to exist in the absence of dependency. 15. However, the High Court erred in setting aside the Tribunal's award as it relates to Appellant No. 2, the mother of the deceased. Appellant No. 2 was aged about 70 years of age at the time of the accident resulting in the death of her daughter, the deceased, and was solely dependent on the deceased as she lived with her and had no independent income, there is no evidence on record to rebut the same. 16. The obligation of a child to maintain their parent in old age is as much of a duty as the obligation of a parent to maintain their child during minority. The deceased, being the only provider, would be assumed to be fulfilling this obligation, further reinforcing Appellant No. 2's status as a dependent. Therefore, the untimely demise of the deceased may create difficulties for Appellant No. 2 going forward, resulting in hardship. Even if it is assumed that Appellant No. 2 was not dependent on the deceased at the time of the accident, the possibility of future dependency cannot be disregarded. 17.

That decision is not applicable to the present case, insofar as Appellant No. 2 is concerned, for the reasons set out above. 18. The Tribunal vide its order had awarded Rs. 15,97,000/- as compensation to the Appellants. However, in our considered opinion, the Tribunal did not consider all the factors laid down by this Court in National Insurance Company Limited v. Pranay Sethi, (2017) 16 SCC 680 and Sarla Verma (Smt.) and Ors. v. Delhi Transport Corporation and Anr., (2009) 6 SCC 121, such as loss of future income and estate, quantum to be awarded for funeral expenses, loss of consortium. We have done our own calculation for awarding compensation to Appellant No. 2, which is as follows: Calculation of Compensation Income of the deceased [monthly] Rs. 24,406 Future Prospect 15% Deduction of personal & living expenses 50% Total Monthly Income 24,406 + 3660 - 50% = Rs. 14,033 Multiplier [age 51-55] 11 Loss of Future Income 14,033 x 11 x 12 = Rs. 18,52,356 Funeral Expenses Rs. 15,000 Loss of Estate Rs. 15,000 Loss of Consortium [filial consortium] Rs. 40,000 Total Compensation 18,52,356 + 15,000 + 15,000 + 40,000 = Rs. 19,22,356 19. Thus, taking into consideration all relevant factors such as the total income of the deceased, loss of estate, loss of filial consortium etc, Appellant No. 2 is entitled to compensation of Rs. 19,22,356/-. 20.

Since the plaintiff had already deposited an amount of Rs.6,72,000/- as per receipt Ex.P-31 in compliance to order dated 29.05.2009 passed by the trial Court, therefore, defendants were directed to refund the excess amount deposited by the plaintiff after adjusting the compounding fee in accordance with law.

Statement of defendant No.3 Sh. S.P. Singh-DW-1 highlighted that he was heading Vigilance Team at the time of checking of the premises of the plaintiff. Witness admitted in his cross-examination that 3 phase meter was installed in the premises of the plaintiff. There were five seals. Two seals besides that were fixed by Nigam. In total there were seven seals on the meter, only two were found tampered. In the report of M&T Lab meter body was found tampered, but the description of said tampering has not been given. The defect in the body of meter was not pointed out and how it MOHMED ATIK 2015.10.17 10:26 I attest to the accuracy and authenticity of this document was found to be tampered has not been elaborated. Mere mentioning of word 'meter body found tampered' the same cannot be considered on defined parameters whether there was deformity in the body/shop of the meter or it was found tampered on account of other specifications. Tampering of body has not come forth in terms of any particular specification and, therefore, cannot be taken to be qualified word in order to give exact meaning to the alleged tampering. [17].

[18]. At the time of inspection no shunt connection was found, rather running of excess load on sanctioned load of 10 KW was only found. Five seals were found intact, therefore, it was not a case of theft of energy. In order to constitute theft of energy and before raising such a presumption under Section 39 of the Act, there must be a dishonest abstraction of energy by an artificial means and consumption thereof has to be established.

Since it is not a case of theft of energy, therefore, question No.(i) as framed by the appellants has to be answered in negative.

Apparently Sections 126 and 135 of the 2003 Act if read together would constitute a complete code in themselves covering all relevant consideration for passing of an order of assessment in cases which do not fall under Section 135 of the 2003 Act. There is mark distinction in the contents of Section 126 and Section 135 of 2003 Act. Both are distinct and different provision, which operate in different field having no common premise in law. Theft has been defined in Section 135 of the 2003 Act which falls under part XIV relating to offences and penalties. Title of Section is 'theft of electricity'. The word 'dishonestly' appearing in the Section denotes abstract or consumption or use of electricity by dishonest means which is punishable under Section 135 of the 2003 Act. The mechanism for dealing under Section 135 of 2003 Act is based on dishonest abstraction and consumption of energy. Besides imposition of punishment as specified under these provisions or the proviso thereto, Section (1A) of Section 135 of the 2003 Act provides that without prejudice to the provisions of the 2003 Act, licensee or MOHMED ATIK 2015.10.17 10:26 I attest to the accuracy and authenticity of this document supplier through officer of rank as authorised may immediately disconnect the supply of electricity and even take other measures enumerated under sub-Sections (2) to (4) of the said Section. The fine which may be imposed under Section 135 of the 2003 Act is directly proportional to the number of convictions and is also dependent on the extent of load abstracted. [21]. Contra to the aforesaid provisions, Section 126 of the 2003 Act would be applicable to the cases where there is no theft of energy but energy is being consumed in violation of terms and conditions"}, {"source": "Dakshin Haryana Bijli Vs.

Contra to the aforesaid provisions, Section 126 of the 2003 Act would be applicable to the cases where there is no theft of energy but energy is being consumed in violation of terms and conditions of supply leading to authorised used of energy. Such malpractice squarely falls within the expression 'unauthorised use of electricity'. The proceeding would start with the inspection of the premises by an Assessing Officer and he would record the finding that the consumer is indulging in unauthorised use of energy. The Assessing Officer shall provisionally assess to the best of his judgment, the electricity charges payable by such consumer as well as pass a provisional assessment order in terms of Section 126(2) of the 2003 Act. The Officer is also under obligation to serve a notice in terms of Section 126(3) of the 2003 Act on the consumer, requiring him to file his objections, if any against the provisional assessment before passing of final order of assessment within 30 days of from the date of service of such order of provisional assessment.

Sirohi Medical (Theft of Electricity).PDF", "chunk_id": 12, "text": "[22]. The explanation to Section 126 of the 2003 Act is of some significance. Section 126 of the 2003 Act falls under chapter XII and relates to investigation and enforcement and empowers the Assessing Officer to pass order of assessment, whereas Section 135 of 2003 Act deals with an offence of theft of energy and the penalty that can be imposed for such theft. This falls under the domain of criminal jurisprudence where mens rea is one of the relevant factor for finding a case of theft. Section 126 of the 2003 Act does not talk about any criminal intendment and primarily revolves around an action and remedy available under civil law. It does not have any mens rea or the ailments which are traceable to the criminal Dakshin Haryana Bijli Vitran ... vs M/S Sirohi Medical Center on 12 October, 2015 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/134707852/ 6 concept of mens rea. [23]. In this way Section 126 of the 2003 Act deals with cases of unauthorised use of energy in the absence of intention/mens rea whereas Section 135 of the 2003 Act deals with an offence of theft of energy where mens rea is the relevant factor. The cases under Section 126 of the 2003 Act would certainly be different from the cases where dishonest abstraction of electricity by means of artificial methods enlisted under Section 135 of the 2003 Act. [24]. Consumption of excessive load as against sanctioned load simpliciter would attract applicability in terms of Section 126 of the 2003 Act. On the other hand where a consumer, by any of the means and methods as specified under Section 135(a) to 135(e) of the 2003 Act, has abstracted energy with dishonest intention and MOHMED ATIK 2015.10.17 10:26 I attest to the accuracy and authenticity of this document without"}, {"source": "Dakshin Haryana Bijli Vs.

[25]. Section 135 of the 2003 Act uses the word 'whoever, dishonestly' does any act of the listed actions so as to abstract or consume electricity would be punished in accordance with provisions of the 2003 Act. In this way a distinction has been made between Sections 126 and 135 of the 2003 Act which operate in different fields and have no overlapping mechanism. [26]. In the instant case, since no evidence of direct connection/shunt connection or direct connection bypassing the installed meter, has been found, therefore, the case does not fall under any of the listed actions so as to abstract or consume electricity. Finding the meter to be running on genuine parameters is a fact in addition to aforesaid phenomena which makes the present case distinct from the applicability of Section 135 of the 2003 Act. The ambit and scope under Section 126 of the 2003 Act with reference to the construction of the words 'unauthorised use' and 'means' are to be judged differently from the words 'whoever, dishonestly' does any act of listed actions so as to abstract or consume electricity which falls under the ambit of Section 135 of the 2003 Act.

Therefore, whenever the consumer consumes electricity in excess of the maximum of the contracted load would be governed by Section 126 of the 2003 Act unless and until he is found to have abstracted or using electricity dishonestly in terms of any of the listed actions under Section 135 of the Act, like providing for direct connection bypassing the installed meter that is where the consumer, by any of the means and methods as specified under Section 135(a) to 135 (e) of the 2003 Act as abstracted energy with dishonest intention without authorisation. Highlighted mechanism is based on the interpretation given by the Apex Court in Executive Engineer and another v. M/s Sri Seetaram Rice Mill, 2012(1) Law Herald (SC) 205. [28]. The remaining question with regard to jurisdiction of the civil Court has to be answered in the light of nature of notice issued to the plaintiff by the defendants.

The defendants have raised illegal demand of huge amount of penalty on account of alleged theft of energy which is against the scheme of the 2003 Act. The bar of civil Court jurisdiction is only applicable where dispute falls within the purview of Section 126 of the 2003 Act. The demand of illegal amount is based on allegation of theft of energy, therefore, the contemplating action does not falls within the purview of Section 126 of the 2003 Act and the civil Court jurisdiction to entertain such a relief is maintainable.

Additionally, the respondent sought to permanently injunct the appellant from alienating the property in favour of any third party.

Given this, the appellant put forth his contention that the deadline of 90 days could be relaxed keeping in view the facts and circumstances of a case; and argued that he himself had personally appeared on all dates of hearing and the lapse was on the part of his Counsel, due to which written statement could not be filed. The appellant claims that severe prejudice would be caused to him if the delay is not condoned for he would be left defenceless in the civil suit. He accordingly seeks that this Court invoke its inherent discretion under Order VIII Rule 1 of CPC and grant one final opportunity to file his written statement. 10.

At the outset, it must be noted that the Commercial Courts Act, 2015 through Section 16 has amended the CPC in its application to commercial disputes to provide as follows: Page | 5 \u201c16.

The present civil suit had been filed by the respondent for a decree of specific performance of an agreement to sell one floor of an ancestral property located in Devli Village, Delhi and permanent injunction against alienation of the same by petitioner to third parties. Counsel for respondent has not contested the non\u2212commercial nature of the dispute, and even independently we are satisfied that the dispute does not fall within the parameters specified under Section 2(c) of the Commercial Courts Act, 2015 and in particular sub\u2212clause (vii), as the immovable property here is not of a nature which is \u201cused exclusively in trade or commerce\u201d. Hence, the appellant is correct in contending that the High Court overlooked the nature of the dispute and 4 (2018) 6 SCC 639.

However, it is clear from the facts on record that numerous opportunities had been accorded to the appellant. He was served on 01.05.2017 and entered appearance through counsel on 15.05.2017.

The only defence taken to these repeated and blatant lapses is that the appellant\u2019s counsel was not turning up. No attempt has been made to even proffer a reasoned justification or explanation, and it is clear that appellant is seeking condonation in a casual manner. This ought not to be permitted or encouraged. Courts must act stringently to ensure that all proceedings are decided within reasonable time, and it is but the duty of the judicial system to cultivate a culture of respecting deadlines and time Page | 9 of the Court, its officers as well as of adversaries. 20.

It is the contention of the learned counsel for the appellant that the Courts below have not appreciated the fact that the suit was not maintainable as it was a case of theft and the jurisdiction of the Civil Court is barred under Section 135 of the Electricity Act, 2003. That apart, he contends that at the time of checking of the meter in the premises of the respondent-plaintiff, the seal of the meter was found tempered with and, therefore, it was a clear case of theft, which report was prepared in the presence of the son of the respondent-plaintiff who had duly signed the said report. He asserts that the finding, as recorded by the Courts below that the notice has not been given to the respondent- plaintiff which has resulted in violation of the principles of natural justice, thus, cannot sustain.

The report L1 only mentions that there is tempering of the seal of the meter, which cannot constitute a theft in the light of the judgment of this Court in Harbhajan Singh and others v. State of Punjab and another, 2002 (4) RCR (Civil) 133 as also the judgment in Kamaljeet Singh v. The Bihar State Electricity Board, 2011 (1) RCR (Civil) 745, where it has been held that merely because seals were found tempered, there is no legal or factual presumption of meter tempering and power theft. In the Punjab State Electricity Board and another v. Firm New Era Printing Mills, Batala Road Amritsar, 2009 (3) LJR 618, it has been observed by this Court that \"to prove the theft of electricity, the basic requirement is that the meter must have been checked from concerned laboratory.\" 5. In the light of the above principles, the real report, which would determine whether there was a theft of electricity or not, would be the report of the M & T Laboratory. Admittedly, no notice is proved to have been served upon the respondent-plaintiff as to the date on which the meter was being checked in the said laboratory. In the absence of there being any proof that the respondent had an opportunity to present herself in the lab at the time of testing of the meter, the principles of natural justice are rightly held to have been violated.

As the opportunity of hearing, as has been provided for in the Rules itself, is not proved by the appellant-defendant to have been given, then the principles of natural justice have been violated. The said report, which has been taken at the back of the respondent-plaintiff, cannot be made the basis for asserting that there was theft of electricity.

Nyapathy Vijay, J. - Civil Miscellaneous Appeal No.982 of 2010 The present C.M.A is filed under Section 30 of Workmen's Compensation Act, 1923 questioning the Order dated 12.11.2009 in W.C.No.12 of 2005 passed by the Commissioner for Workmen's Compensation & Deputy Commissioner of Labour (FAC), Anantapur, Anantapur District. 2. The O.P.No.2-Insurance Company is the Appellant herein. 3. The facts leading to filing of the present appeal are as follows:- The Claimants are the wife, children and parents of one B. Ramanjaneyulu (hereinafter referred to as 'deceased'). The deceased was employed under O.P.No.1 as Hamali in his Tractor & Trailer bearing Nos.AP-02-K-1278 & 1279. The deceased was being paid Rs. 4,500/- per month by way of his avocation. The Tractor & Trailer was being used to carry gravel from hillock situated in Ramapuram Village to the surrounding work spot where gravel was required. The practice was that the driver of the O.P.No.1/owner used to collect coolies from Challavaripalli and Ramapuram Villages etc. and used to go to hillock for chipping the gravel and loading it on the Tractor and Trailer for unloading the same at the required spot. 4. While so, on 24.08.2004, the deceased along with other co-workers boarded the Trailer and while the vehicle was proceeding towards hillock there was a sudden jerk in the movement of the vehicle, the deceased fell down and the wheel of the Trailer ran over him causing grievous injuries. The deceased was immediately shifted to a private Doctor at Narpala, where he was declared dead. As the deceased died in the course of employment, the compensation was sought from O.P.No.1.

O.P.No.1/owner filed his counter admitting to the accident and that the deceased was working as Hamali under him, but denied the wages of Rs. 4,000/- per month. It was also pleaded by O.P.No.1/owner in his counter that the vehicle was insured with O.P.No.2-Insurance Company and the O.P.No.2 alone is liable to pay compensation. 6. O.P.No.2-Insurance Company filed its counter denying the claim by disputing the manner of occurrence of accident, wages, the age of the deceased and the jural relationship between the deceased and O.P.No.1/owner as well as the license of the driver of the tractor. It was also pleaded that the deceased was working as a stone cutter but not as a Hamali and that the deceased was negligently standing in between the tractor and trailer connecting with the iron rod, the deceased fell under the Trailer on account of jerking, which resulted in the death. As the deceased was negligently standing in the trailer, no liability can be fastened on the O.P.No.2- Insurance Company. 7. On the basis of respective pleadings, the Commissioner framed the following issues:- 1) Whether the deceased was a workman as per the provisions of the workmen's compensation Act, 1923 and he met the accident arising out of and in the course of his employment resulting in to death? 2) Relationship of employee-employer between driver and Opposite Party-1? 2 / 5 LAW FINDER Licensed To: Nitish Garg PDF downloaded", "page": 2}, {"source": "Divisional Manager v.

In the course of enquiry, the Claimant No.1 i.e. the wife of the deceased was examined as A.W.1 and she reiterated the claim averments and got marked Exs.A.1 to A.5 i.e. attested Xerox copy of F.I.R, attested Copy of Inquest Report, attested Xerox copy of Post Mortem Certificate, Office copy of Notice issued to the Respondents and Postal Receipts respectively in support of her claim. 9. One B. Peddanna, who was working along with the deceased and eking livelihood as Hamali and being an eyewitness to the accident was examined as A.W.2.

The employer/O.P.No.1 also filed his chief affidavit as P.W.1 stating that the deceased was working as a labourer in his tractor along with others. It was deposed in his chief affidavit that the deceased along with others were engaged to bring the stones required for fencing around his land to prevent cattle and other animals from entering into the land. It was deposed that on 24.08.2004 O.P.No.1/owner had instructed the driver to pick up the deceased and other workers to bring stones from the hillock, which are required for fencing around his land to prevent cattle from entering into the land and the accident occurred in the", "page": 3}, {"source": "Divisional Manager v.

O.P.No.1 was also cross examined by O.P.No.2-Insurance Company and in his cross examination, he stated that the deceased was working under him six months prior to the accident and he used to pay wages on daily basis. The specific averment in the chief affidavit of the O.P.No.1/owner that the deceased and other workers were going to hillock to bring stones for fencing his land to prevent cattle etc. on that particular day was not questioned in the cross examination by O.P.No.2-Insurance Company. 12. On behalf of O.P.No.2-Insurance Company, one Sri.

In the present appeal, two grounds were urged by the counsel for the Appellant that the Insurance company should not be made liable for the compensation when the O.P.No.1/owner had admitted that no premium was paid covering the deceased Coolie. It was also argued that the vehicle was insured only for agricultural purpose, but the vehicle was being used for non- agricultural purpose and therefore no liability can be fastened on the insurance company. 16. The counsel for the Respondents argued in support of the order of the Commissioner and that the Commissioner considered Ex.B.2 policy and noted that the amount of Rs. 1,737/- was paid towards third party premium and as the premium was paid towards third party, the insurance company cannot disown its liability to pay compensation. As regards the usage of the vehicle for non-agricultural purpose, it was contended by the counsel for the respondents that the O.P.No.1/owner was not cross examined on this aspect and the specific deposition of O.P.No.1 that the vehicle was being used for the purpose of bringing stones so as to enable fencing around land of O.P.No.1/owner on that particular day. Since this aspect of chief examination of O.P.No.1 was not cross examined by O.P.No.2-Insurance Company, it is not open for the Appellant- Insurance Company to raise this issue in the present appeal. 17. Having heard the respective contentions, this Court opines as under:- Regarding the first ground that no premium was paid to cover the deceased, it is to be noted that deceased was travelling as a workman and is not a gratuitous passenger. The Section 145 (i) of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988 was amended vide the Motor Vehicles (Amendment) Act, 2019 elaborating the term 'third party'.

The amended Section 145 (1) reads as under: 145 (i) \"third party\" includes the Government, the driver and any other co-worker on a transport vehicle. 18. This Court in National Insurance Co. Ltd. v. Savidi Anjaneyulu, 2024 SCC Online AP 4840 has held that the amendment to the definition of Section 145 (i) of the Motor Vehicles (Amendment) Act, 2019 is only clarificatory and therefore it is applicable retrospectively covering the risk of the driver or any other co-worker on transport vehicle as third-party. 19. In the instant case, the deceased being a Hamali cannot be said to be a gratuitous passenger and comes within the amended definition of 'third party' under section 145(i) of the Motor Vehicles (Amendment) Act, 2019 as it stands today and would be covered by Ex.B.2 Policy. 20. The second contention of the counsel for the Appellant- Insurance Company is that the vehicle was used for non-agricultural purpose and liability should not be imposed on the insurance company. As rightly contended by the counsel for the Respondents, O.P.No.1/owner had clearly deposed in Paragraph 2 of his chief examination affidavit that the vehicle on that particular day was being used to bring stones from the hillock for the purpose of fencing of his land to prevent cattle etc. from entering into his land.

In the absence of any cross examination on this aspect, by the Insurance Company, the same would amount to admission by the insurance company regarding the purpose of usage of the vehicle on that particular day.

JUDGMENT Dipak Misra, CJI. - The legal representatives of the deceased, Jagir Singh, the husband of the second respondent, preferred a claim petition being MACT Case No. 70 of 2013 under section 166 of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988 (for brevity, `the Act') before the Motor Accident Claims Tribunal, Pathankot (for short, `the tribunal') claiming compensation to the tune of L 36,00,000/-. The claim petition was filed on the basis that on 19.02.2013, Jagir Singh was travelling to Pathankot on his motor cycle and at that juncture, the offending truck bearing temporary registration No. PB-06-6894 belonging to the appellant No. 2 driven in a rash and negligent manner hit the motor cycle of the deceased as a result of which he sustained multiple injuries, and eventually, succumbed to the same when being taken to the hospital. The claim put forth was sought to be sustained on many a basis which need not be adverted to. 2. The insurer, the first respondent herein, opposed the claim on the ground that the vehicle in question was driven in violation of the terms of the insurance policy and further the driver was not having a valid and effective driving license and, therefore, it was not obliged to indemnify the insured. That apart, a stand was taken that the vehicle did not have the permit on the date of the accident.

That apart, a stand was taken that the vehicle did not have the permit on the date of the accident. On behalf of the owner of the vehicle and driver, assertions were made that the vehicle was insured with the first respondent as per the insurance policy, that the vehicle was registered and the driver had the requisite driving licence. Additionally, copy of the route permit of the offending truck was brought on record. 3. The tribunal noted that the vehicle was purchased in September 2012 and insured on 20.12.2012. It was registered on 26.02.2013. The accident, as stated earlier, occurred on 19.02.2013. The tribunal, placing reliance on the decision rendered by this Court in National Insurance Co. Ltd. v. Challa Bharathamma and others, (2004) 8 SCC 517, held that the insurer was not liable and proceeded to quantify the amount of compensation and determined the same at L 15,63,120/-. The tribunal directed the amount to be paid by the insurer along with interest at the rate of 9% from the date of award till its realisation and recover the same from the owner and driver of the vehicle. A further direction was given for attachment of the truck in question till the award was satisfied. 4. The award dated 20.11.2014 passed by the tribunal was challenged in FAO No. 1702 of 2016 before the High Court of Punjab and Haryana at Chandigarh. It was contended in appeal that the appellant No. 2, the owner of the offending vehicle, had deposited the necessary fees along with application on 19.02.2013 for issue of route permit and the same was issued on 27.02.2013. It was further urged that when the owner of the vehicle had already submitted the documents in the transport office for grant"}, {"source": "Amrit Paul Singh v.

It was further urged that when the owner of the vehicle had already submitted the documents in the transport office for grant of permit along with the requisite fees, the tribunal was in error in holding that the vehicle was being plied without a valid permit. In support of the submissions, reliance was placed upon Ashok Kumar Khemaka v. Oriental Insurance Company Ltd. and other, 2014 (3) RCR (Civil) 1018, National Insurance Company Limited v. Kamlesh Kaur and others, 2006 (3) RCR (Civil) 634 and Moti Ram v. ICICI Lombard and others, 2015 ACJ 1793. 5. The High Court scrutinized Annexure A-1 which was filed to justify the stand that the application for issue of the route permit was made to the competent authority and, on a scrutiny of the same, came to hold that the owner had not been able to establish that he had submitted the application for issue of permit before the accident. Referring to Section 66 of the Act and placing reliance on Challa Bharathamma case, the High Court opined that even assuming that the owner had already applied for grant of the permit before the accident, the same would not entitle the owner to ply the vehicle. It is worthy to note that the learned single Judge distinguished the decisions cited before him and, resultantly, confirmed the award of the tribunal. 6. We have heard Mr. Sudhir Walia, learned counsel for the appellants, and Mr. Amit Kumar Singh, learned counsel for the respondent-insurer. 7.

The conclusions recorded by the tribunal and further confirmed by the High Court clearly show that the accident occurred on 19.02.2013 and the competent authority issued the permit on 27.02.2013. In this regard, Sections 2(28) and 2(31) of the Act that define \"motor vehicle\" or \"vehicle\" and \"permit\" are reproduced below:- \"(28) \"motor vehicle\" or \"vehicle\" means any mechanically propelled vehicle adapted for use upon roads whether the power of propulsion is transmitted thereto from an external or internal source and includes a chassis to which a body has not been attached and a trailer; but does not include a vehicle running upon fixed rails or a vehicle of a special type adapted for use only in a factory or in any other enclosed premises or a vehicle having less than four wheels fitted with engine capacity of not exceeding twenty-five cubic centimetres; (31) \"permit\" means a permit issued by a State or Regional Transport Authority or an authority prescribed in this behalf under this Act authorising the use of a motor vehicle as a transport vehicle;\" On a perusal of both the definitions, it is quite clear that a permit has to be issued by the competent authority under the Act for use of a motor vehicle as a transport vehicle. The emphasis is on the words \"use\" as well as \"transport vehicle\". 8. Section 2(47) states that \"transport vehicle\" means a public service vehicle, a goods carriage, an educational institution bus or a private service vehicle.

Section 2(47) states that \"transport vehicle\" means a public service vehicle, a goods carriage, an educational institution bus or a private service vehicle. Section 66 stipulates necessity for permits. Sub-section (1) thereof provides that no owner of a motor vehicle shall use or permit the use of the vehicle as a transport vehicle in any public place, whether or not such vehicle is actually carrying any passengers or goods save in accordance with the conditions of a permit granted or countersigned by a Regional or State Transport Authority or any prescribed authority. Various provisos have been appended to the main provision stipulating conditions for use of the vehicle and purpose of carriage of goods vehicle. Sub-section (2) states that the holder of a goods carriage permit may use the vehicle for the drawing of any trailer or semi-trailer not owned by him, subject to such conditions as may be prescribed. It is necessary to mention here that a proviso has been added by Act 54 of 1994 with effect from 14.11.1994 allowing the holder of a permit of any articulated vehicle to use the prime-mover of that articulated vehicle for any other semi-trailer. Section 2(2) defines \"articulated vehicle\" to mean a motor vehicle to which a semi-trailer is attached. 9. It is apt to note here that sub-section (3) of Section 66 carves out certain exceptions to sub-section (1). The relevant part of sub-section (3) is extracted below:- \"(3) The provisions of sub-section (1) shall not apply- (a) to any transport vehicle owned by the Central Government or a State Government and used for Government purposes unconnected with any commercial enterprise; (b) to any transport vehicle owned by a local authority or by a person acting under contract with a local authority and used solely for road cleansing,"}, {"source": "Amrit Paul Singh v.

In the case at hand, the findings would show that the appellant No. 2 did not have a permit for the vehicle. There is no dispute that the vehicle initially had a temporary registration and eventually the permanent registration. It is the stand of the appellants that the tribunal and the High Court did not appreciate that the chasis of the vehicle was sent to the body where the body of the truck was fabricated and when the vehicle was driven out of the work shop at which point of time it met with an accident. A contention has been made that the insurance policy was in force at the relevant time and, hence, the insurer is legally obliged to indemnify the insured.

A contention has been made that the insurance policy was in force at the relevant time and, hence, the insurer is legally obliged to indemnify the insured. A distinction has to be made between \"route permit\" and \"permit\" in the context of Section 149 of the Act. Section 149(2) provides the grounds that can be taken as defence by the insurer. It enables the insurer to defend on the ground that there has been breach of a specific condition of the policy, namely, (i) a condition that excludes the use of the vehicle, -(a) for hire or reward, where the vehicle is, on the date of the contract of insurance, a vehicle not covered by a permit to ply for hire or reward, or (b) for organized racing and speed testing, or (c) for a purpose not allowed by the permit under which the vehicle is used, where the vehicle is a transport vehicle, or (d) without side-car being attached where the vehicle is a motor cycle. That apart, it also entitles the insurer to raise the issue pertaining to a condition that excludes driving by a named person or persons or by any person who is not duly licensed or by any person who has been disqualified for holding or obtaining a driving licence during the period of disqualification or that excludes liability for injury caused or contributed to by conditions of war, civil war, riot or civil commotion.

A further defence that can be availed of by the insurer is that the policy is void on the ground that it has been obtained by non-disclosure of the material fact or by representation of act which is false in the material particular. 11. On a perusal of the written statement filed by the owner and the driver, it is evident that the factum of accident having been caused by the vehicle in question had been denied. That apart, there is also a denial of liability that relates to the manner in which the accident had occurred as alleged in the claim petition. It was the specific assertion of the insurer before the tribunal that the vehicle was running in contravention of the provisions of the Act, for it did not possess a route permit. The tribunal, on the basis of the materials brought on record to the effect that the route permit was issued on 27.02.2013 and the accident occurred on 19.02.2013, returned a finding that the vehicle in question did not have the permit. As stated earlier, the High Court has affirmed the same. 12. Learned counsel for the appellants would submit that in the obtaining factual matrix, the breach would not exonerate the insurer from satisfying the judgment and an award in terms of Section 149 of the Act. He has drawn inspiration from the decision of a three-Judge Bench in National Insurance Co. Ltd v. Swaran Singh and others, (2004) 3 SCC 297. In the said case, the Court was dealing with the interpretation of Section 149(2)(a)(ii) vis-a-vis the proviso appended to sub-sections (4) and (5) of Section 149 of the Act.

The issue centrally pertained to the necessity of having a driving licence. After adverting to various provisions, the Court also delved into the fundamental concept of third party right. Regard being had to the nature of the beneficial legislation, the Court observed:- \"39. The question as to whether an insurer can avoid its liability in the event it raises a defence as envisaged in sub-section (2) of Section 149 of the Act corresponding to sub-section (2) of section 96 of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1939 had been the subject-matter of decisions in a large number of cases.\" 13. The Court posed the question as to whether an insurer can avoid its liability in the event it raised the defence as envisaged in sub-section (2) of Section 149 of the Act corresponding to sub-section (2) of section 96 of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1939. The Court analysed the language employed in sub-section (2) of Section 149, specifically clause (a), and, after scrutinizing the same and referring to various authorities, opined:- \"69. The proposition of law is no longer res integra that the person who alleges breach must prove the same. The insurance company is, thus, required to establish the said breach by cogent evidence. In the event the insurance company fails to prove that there has been breach of conditions of policy on the part of the insured, the insurance company cannot be absolved of its liability.

P. Sesh Reddy and others, (1996) 5 SCC 21) 70. Apart from the above, we do not intend to lay down anything further i.e. degree of proof which would satisfy the aforementioned requirement inasmuch as the same would indisputably depend upon the facts and circumstances of each case. It will also depend upon the terms of contract of insurance. Each case may pose a different problem which must be resolved having regard to a large number of factors governing the case including conduct of parties as regards duty to inform, correct disclosure, suppression, fraud on the insurer etc. It will also depend upon the fact as to who is the owner of the vehicle and the circumstances in which the vehicle was being driven by a person having no valid and effective licence. No hard-and-fast rule can, therefor, be laid down. If in a given case there exists sufficient material to draw an adverse inference against either the insurer or the insured, the Tribunal may do so. The parties alleging breach must be held to have succeeded in establishing the breach of conditions of the contract of insurance, on the part of the insurer by discharging its burden of proof. The Tribunal, there cannot be any doubt, must arrive at a finding on the basis of the materials available on records. 71. In the aforementioned backdrop, the provisions of sub-sections (4) and (5) of section 149 of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988 may be considered as to the liability of the insurer to satisfy the decree at the first instance. x x x 83.

Sub-section (5) of Section 149 which imposes a liability on the insurer must also be given its full effect. The insurance company may not be liable to satisfy the decree and, therefore, its liability may be zero but it does not mean that it did not have initial liability at all. Thus, if the insurance company is made liable to pay any amount, it can recover the entire amount paid to the third party on behalf of the assured. If this interpretation is not given to the beneficent provisions of the Act having regard to its purport and object, we fail to see a situation where beneficent provisions can be given effect to. Sub-section (7) of Section 149 of the Act, to which pointed attention of the Court has been drawn by the learned counsel for the petitioner, which is in negative language may now be noticed. The said provision must be read with sub-section (1) thereof. The right to avoid liability in terms of sub-section (2) of Section 149 is restricted as has been discussed hereinbefore. It is one thing to say that the insurance companies are entitled to raise a defence but it is another thing to say that despite the fact that its defence has been accepted having regard to the facts and circumstances of the case, the Tribunal has power to direct them to satisfy the decree at the first instance and then direct recovery of the same from the owner.

We may fruitfully note that the three-Judge Bench adverted to situations where the driver does not have a licence and the same has been allowed to be driven by the owner of the vehicle by such person, the insurer would be entitled to succeed in defence and avoid liability, but the position would be different where the disputed question of fact arises as to whether the driver had a valid licence and where the owner of the vehicle committed a breach of the terms of the contract of insurance as also the provisions of the Act by consciously allowing any person to drive a vehicle who did not have a valid driving licence. 15. The Court held that if, on facts, it is found that the accident was caused solely because of some other unforeseen or intervening causes like mechanical failures and similar other causes having no nexus with the driver not possessing the requisite type of licence, the insurer will not be allowed to avoid its liability merely for technical breach of conditions concerning driving licence. That apart, minor and inconsequential deviations with regard to licensing conditions would not constitute sufficient ground to deny the benefit of coverage of insurance to third parties. The other category of cases that the Court addressed to included cases where the licence of the driver is found to be fake. In that context, the Court expressed its general agreement with United India Insurance Co. Limited v. Lehru, (2003) 3 SCC 338 and stated thus:- \"92. ...

In Lehru case the matter has been considered in some detail. We are in general agreement with the approach of the Bench but we intend to point out that the observations made therein must be understood to have been made in the light of the requirements of the law in terms whereof the insurer is to establish wilful breach on the part of the insured and not for the purpose of its disentitlement from raising any defence or for the owners to be absolved from any liability whatsoever ..\" 16. The three-Judge Bench summed up its conclusions and we think it appropriate to reproduce the relevant part of the same:- \"110. (iii) The breach of policy condition e.g. disqualification of the driver or invalid driving licence of the driver, as contained in sub-section (2)(a)(ii) of Section 149, has to be proved to have been committed by the insured for avoiding liability by the insurer. Mere absence, fake or invalid driving licence or disqualification of the driver for driving at the relevant time, are not in themselves defences available to the insurer against either the insured or the third parties. To avoid its liability towards the insured, the insurer has to prove that the insured was guilty of negligence and failed to exercise reasonable care in the matter of fulfilling the condition of the policy regarding use of vehicles by a duly licensed driver or one who was not disqualified to drive at the relevant time. x x x x (vi) Even where the insurer is able to prove"}, {"source": "Amrit Paul Singh v.

The Tribunals in interpreting the policy conditions would apply \"the rule of main purpose\" and the concept of \"fundamental breach\" to allow defences available to the insurer under Section 149(2) of the Act. (vii) The question, as to whether the owner has taken reasonable care to find out as to whether the driving licence produced by the driver (a fake one or otherwise), does not fulfil the requirements of law or not will have to be determined in each case.\" 17. Learned counsel for the appellants would submit that there has been no fundamental breach of the policy conditions. In this context, we may profitably refer to the decision in Challa Bharathamma (supra) wherein a two-Judge Bench squarely dealt with the absence of a permit and ruled that plying a vehicle without a permit is an infraction and insurer is not liable. 18. In Lakhmi Chand v. Reliance General Insurance, (2016) 3 SCC 100, the Court was concerned with an order passed by the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission (NCDRC) that had declined the relief to the petitioner therein.

Reliance General Insurance, (2016) 3 SCC 100, the Court was concerned with an order passed by the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission (NCDRC) that had declined the relief to the petitioner therein. The insurer in the said case had taken the plea that the complainant had violated the terms and conditions of the policy, for five passengers were travelling in the goods carrying vehicle at the time of the accident, whereas the permitted seating capacity of the motor vehicle of the appellant was only 1 + 1. The two-Judge Bench referred to Oriental Insurance Co. Ltd. v. Meena Variyal and others, (2007) 5 SCC 428 and expressed the view that in order to avoid liability, the insurer must establish that there was breach on the part of the insured. 19. The obtaining fact situation is sought to be equated with the factual score in the said case. In this regard, it is useful to refer to the Bench decision in HDFC Bank Limited v. Reshma and others, (2015) 3 SCC 679. The issue that arose before the Court was whether the financier was liable to pay the compensation or it was the liability of the borrower. The tribunal had returned the finding that the duty of the financier was to see that the borrower did not neglect to get the vehicle insured and, therefore, it was jointly and severally liable along with the owner. The High Court had concurred with the said conclusion. The Court referred to Purnya Kala Devi v. State of Assam and other, (2014) 14 SCC 142 that has dealt with the definition of the term \"owner\" as contained in Section 2(30) of the Act. In the said case, the vehicle"}, {"source": "Amrit Paul Singh v. TATA AIG (SC NO ROUTE Permit insurance Co.

State of Assam and other, (2014) 14 SCC 142 that has dealt with the definition of the term \"owner\" as contained in Section 2(30) of the Act. In the said case, the vehicle in question was under the requisition of the State of Assam under the provisions of law. In that context, the Court has expressed that:- \"16. ... The High Court failed to appreciate that at the relevant time the offending vehicle was under the requisition of Respondent 1 State of Assam under the provisions of the Assam Act. Therefore, Respondent 1 was squarely covered under the definition of `owner' as contained in Section 2(30) of the 1988 Act. The High Court failed to appreciate the underlying legislative intention in including in the definition of `owner' a person in possession of a vehicle either under an agreement of lease or agreement of hypothecation or under a hire-purchase agreement to the effect that a person in control and possession of the vehicle should be construed as the `owner' and not alone the registered owner. The High Court further failed to appreciate the legislative intention that the registered owner of the vehicle should not be held liable if the vehicle was not in his possession and control. The High Court also failed to appreciate that Section 146 of the 1988 Act requires that no person shall use or cause or allow any other person to use a motor vehicle in a public place without an insurance policy meeting the requirements of Chapter XI of the 1988 Act and the State Government has violated the statutory provisions of the 1988 Act.\" 20.

Be it noted, in the said case, the liability was fixed on the State keeping in view the legislative intention behind Section 146 of the Act, no person shall use or cause or allow any other person to use a motor vehicle in a public place without an insurance policy as that is the mandatory statutory requirement under the Act. Emphasis was laid on possession and control of the vehicle and accordingly liability was fixed on the State of Assam. 21. In HDFC Bank Limited (supra), the three-Judge Bench opined that the hypothecation agreement did not convey that the appellant financier had become the owner and was in control and possession of the vehicle. It was the absolute fault of the respondent No. 2 to take the vehicle from the dealer without full payment of the insurance, more so when nothing had been brought on record that the said fact was known to the appellant financier or that it was done in collusion with the financier. 22. The Court held that when the intention of the legislature is quite clear to the effect that a registered owner of the vehicle should not be held liable if the vehicle is not in his possession and control and there was evidence on record that the respondent No. 2, plied the vehicle without the insurance in violation of the statutory provision contained in Section 146 of the Act, the High Court could not have mulcted the liability on the financier and finally, the financer was absolved of the liability. 23.

In the case at hand, it is clearly demonstrable from the materials brought on record that the vehicle at the time of the accident did not have a permit. The appellants had taken the stand that the vehicle was not involved in the accident. That apart, they had not stated whether the vehicle had temporary permit or any other kind of permit. The exceptions that have been carved out under Section 66 of the Act, needless to emphasise, are to be pleaded and proved. The exceptions cannot be taken aid of in the course of an argument to seek absolution from liability. Use of a vehicle in a public place without a permit is a fundamental statutory infraction. We are disposed to think so in view of the series of exceptions carved out in Section 66. The said situations cannot be equated with absence of licence or a fake licence or a licence for different kind of vehicle, or, for that matter, violation of a condition of carrying more number of passengers. Therefore, the principles laid down in Swaran Singh (supra) and Lakhmi Chand (supra) in that regard would not be applicable to the case at hand. That apart, the insurer had taken the plea that the vehicle in question had no permit.

Therefore, the tribunal as well as the High Court had directed the insurer was required to pay the compensation amount to the claimants with interest with the stipulation that the insurer shall be entitled to recover the same from the owner and the driver. The said directions are in consonance with the principles stated in Swaran Singh (supra) and other cases pertaining to pay and recover principle. 24.

In view of the above, the stand taken by the petitioner before the trial Court as also this Court that after the demise of his counsel on 02.07.2015, he became aware of the eviction proceedings only on 18.05.2017 is a stand which can only be termed as false.

However, a false stand was taken by the petitioner for seeking stay of the execution proceedings that he came to know about the pendency of the same only a day before the date of filing of the application i.e. on 18.05.2017. 6 of 14 ::: Downloaded on - 25-03-2022 07:22:35 :::", "page": 6}, {"source": "Dhanraj Vs Ved Parkas O9R13 CPC.pdf", "chunk_id": 1, "text": "he came to know about the pendency of the same only a day before the date of filing of the application i.e. on 18.05.2017. 6 of 14 ::: Downloaded on - 25-03-2022 07:22:35 :::", "page": 6}, {"source": "Dhanraj Vs Ved Parkas O9R13 CPC.pdf", "chunk_id": 0, "text": "CR No.8778 of 2017 -7- From the above observations, it is clear that the petitioner's stand that after 02.07.2015 he became aware of the eviction proceedings as also the execution proceedings only on 18.05.2017 is a false stand taken by him and such a finding is based on the afore-quoted judicial orders which remain unchallenged. In fact the afore-quoted orders are found not even referred to by the petitioner in either the application filed by him before the trial Court or in the grounds of the present revision petition and were produced only on the asking of the Court. The petitioner is thus guilty of having approached the Court with unclean hands and has thereby abused the process of the Court by making patently false statements. In fact, in the present case, the Court finds itself in an unfortunate situation wherein a litigant/the petitioner has attempted to use the demise of his counsel to his advantage. The Apex Court in Kishore Samrite v. State of U.P. and others, (2013) 2 SCC 398, has laid down guidelines to deal with litigants who do not approach the Court with clean hands.

This Court has had many occasions where it dealt with the cases of this kind and it has clearly stated the principles that would govern the obligations of a litigant while approaching the court for redressal of any grievance and the consequences of abuse of the process of court. We may recapitulate and state some of the principles. It is difficult to state such principles exhaustively and with such accuracy that would uniformly apply to a variety of cases. These are: (i) Courts have, over the centuries, frowned upon litigants who, with intent to deceive and mislead the Courts, initiated proceedings without full disclosure of facts and came to the courts with `unclean hands'. Courts have held that such litigants are neither entitled to be heard on the merits of the case nor entitled to any relief. (ii) The people, who approach the Court for relief of an ex parte statement, are under a contract with the court that they would state the whole case fully and fairly to the court and where the litigant has broken such faith, the discretion of the court cannot be exercised in favour of such a litigant. (iii) The obligation to approach the Court with clean hands is an absolute obligation and has repeatedly been reiterated by this Court. (iv) Quests for personal gains have become so intense 8 of 14 ::: Downloaded on - 25-03-2022 07:22:35 :::", "page": 8}, {"source": "Dhanraj Vs Ved Parkas O9R13 CPC.pdf", "chunk_id": 0, "text": "CR No.8778 of 2017 -9- that those involved in litigation do not hesitate to take shelter of falsehood and misrepresent and suppress facts in the court proceedings. Materialism, opportunism and malicious intent have over-shadowed the old ethos of litigative values for small gains. (v) A litigant who attempts to pollute the stream of justice or who touches the pure fountain of justice with tainted hands is not entitled to any relief, interim or final. (vi) The Court must ensure that its process is not abused and in order to prevent abuse of the process the court, it would be justified even in insisting on furnishing of security and in cases of serious abuse, the Court would be duty bound to impose heavy costs. (vii) Wherever a public interest is invoked, the Court must examine the petition carefully to ensure that there is genuine public interest involved. The stream of justice should not be allowed to be polluted by unscrupulous litigants. (viii) The Court, especially the Supreme Court, has to maintain strictest vigilance over the abuse of the process of court and ordinarily meddlesome bystanders should not be granted \u201cvisa\u201d.

In dealing with applications for special leave, the Court naturally takes statements of fact and grounds of fact contained in the petitions at their face value and it would be unfair to betray the confidence of the Court by making statements which are untrue and misleading.

Curiously enough, there is no reference in the special leave petitions to any of the stay orders and we came to know about these orders only when the respondents appeared in response to the notice and filed their counter- affidavit. In our view, the said interim orders have a direct bearing on the question raised and the non- disclosure of the same certainly amounts to suppression of material facts. On this ground alone, the special leave petitions are liable to be rejected. It is well settled in law that the relief under Article 136 of the Constitution is discretionary and a petitioner who approaches this Court for such relief must come with frank and full disclosure of facts.

In Dalip Singh v.

Mahavir, Gautam Buddha and Mahatma Gandhi guided the people to ingrain these values in their daily life. Truth constituted an integral part of the justice- delivery system which was in vogue in the pre- Independence era and the people used to feel proud to tell truth in the courts irrespective of the consequences. However, post-Independence period has seen drastic changes in our value system. The materialism has overshadowed the old ethos and the quest for personal gain has become so intense that those involved in litigation do not hesitate to take shelter of falsehood, misrepresentation and suppression of facts in the court proceedings. 2. In the last 40 years, a new creed of litigants has cropped up. Those who belong to this creed do not have any respect for truth. They shamelessly resort to falsehood and unethical means for achieving their goals.

JUDGMENT Dr. Dhananjaya Y. Chandrachud, J. - This appeal arises from a judgment dated 12 January 2022 of the High Court of Gujarat. The High Court dismissed an appeal against the judgment of the Additional Chief Judicial Magistrate dated 30 August 2016 by which the first respondent was acquitted of the offence under section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act 1881. At the core, the issue is whether the offence under Section 138 of the Act would deem to be committed if the cheque that is dishonoured does not represent the enforceable debt at the time of encashment. The Facts 2. On 10 April 2014, the appellant issued a statutory notice under Section 138 of the Act to the first respondent-accused. It was alleged that the first respondent borrowed a sum of rupees twenty lakhs from the appellant on 16 January 2012 and to discharge the liability, issued a cheque dated 17 March 2014 bearing cheque No. 877828 for the said sum. It was further alleged that the cheque when presented on 2 April 2014 was dishonoured due to insufficient funds. The appellant issued the notice calling the first respondent to pay the legally enforceable debt of Rs. 20,00,000/- : \"Therefore, my client hereby calls upon you to make payment of Rs. 20,00,000/- towards the legally enforceable debt due and payable by you within a period of 15 days from the", "page": 4}, {"source": "Dashrath Vs Hitesh 138.pdf", "chunk_id": 1, "text": "The appellant issued the notice calling the first respondent to pay the legally enforceable debt of Rs. 20,00,000/- : \"Therefore, my client hereby calls upon you to make payment of Rs. 20,00,000/- towards the legally enforceable debt due and payable by you within a period of 15 days from the date of receipt of this particular notice, [..]\" 3. On 25 April 2014, the first respondent addressed a response to the Page 4 of 21 Law Finder DocId # 2046163 Licensed to: Sh.Gurpreet Singh Mann,Advocate Bathin... 28-08-2023 Law Finder", "page": 4}, {"source": "Dashrath Vs Hitesh 138.pdf", "chunk_id": 0, "text": "statutory notice where he alleged the following: (i) The first respondent and the appellant are related to each other. The appellant's son married the first respondent's sister; (ii) The appellant lent the first respondent a loan of rupees forty lakhs. There was an oral agreement between the parties that the first respondent would pay rupees one lakh every three months by cheque and rupees eighty thousand in cash to the appellant. Two cheques were given to the appellant for security. It was agreed that the appellant would return both the cheques when the sum lent was paid in full; (iii) The appellant's son-initiated divorce proceedings against the respondent's sister. However, the dowry that was given at the time of marriage is still in the possession of the appellant; and (iv) The cheques that were issued for security have been misused by the appellant. 4. On 12 May 2014, the appellant filed a criminal complaint against the first respondent for the offence under Section 138 of the Act. On 19 May 2014, the first respondent issued another reply to the legal notice. By the said reply, the earlier reply to the legal notice was sought to be amended by replacing the acknowledgment of having received a loan of rupees forty lakhs to rupees twenty lakhs. 5. By a judgment dated 30 August 2016, the Trial Court acquitted the first respondent of the offence under Section 138 on the ground that the first respondent paid the appellant a sum of rupees 4,09,3015 between 8 April 2012 and 30 December 2013 partly discharging his liability in respect of the debt of rupees twenty lakhs.

The appellant filed an appeal against the judgment of the Trial Court before the High Court of Gujarat. On 10 October 2019, the first respondent moved an application before the High Court of Gujarat seeking to place on record the amended reply dated 19 May 2014. By an order dated 11 October 2018, the High Court allowed the application for placing the additional evidence on record. The High Court by its judgment dated 12 January 2022 dismissed the appeal, thereby upholding the judgment of the Trial Court acquitting the first respondent. The High Court affirmed the finding of fact by the Trial Court that a part of the debt owed by the first respondent to the appellant was discharged and thus the notice of demand issued under Section 138 of the Act is not valid. In the course of the analysis, the following findings were entered: (i) The appellant has in the course of his cross-examination accepted that the first respondent had deposited rupees 4,09,315 in his account; (ii) There is a statutory presumption that the sum drawn in the cheque is a debt or liability that is owed by the drawer of the cheque to the drawee.

Mr Nakul Dewan, senior counsel appearing on behalf of the first respondent submitted that: (i) The term `debt or other liability' used in Section 138 of the Act has been defined in the Explanation clause to mean a `legally enforceable debt or other liability'. Thus, the demand made in the statutory notice must be for a sum that is legally enforceable; (ii) If the debtor has paid a part of the debt, a statutory notice seeking the payment of the entire sum in the cheque without any endorsement under Section 56 of the part-payment made would not be legally sustainable; and (iii) Since the first respondent has paid off a part of the debt, the appellant cannot initiate action if the cheque which represented the principal amount without deducting or endorsing a part payment has been dishonoured.

Explanation.-For the purposes of this section, \"debt of other liability\" means a legally enforceable debt or other liability. (emphasis supplied) 10. Section 138 of the Act provides that a drawer of a cheque is deemed to have committed the offence if the following ingredients are fulfilled: Page 8 of 21 Law Finder DocId # 2046163 Licensed to: Sh.Gurpreet Singh Mann,Advocate Bathin... 28-08-2023 Law Finder", "page": 8}, {"source": "Dashrath Vs Hitesh 138.pdf", "chunk_id": 0, "text": "(i) A cheque drawn for the payment of any amount of money to another person; (ii) The cheque is drawn for the discharge of the `whole or part' of any debt or other liability. `Debt or other liability' means legally enforceable debt or other liability; and (iii) The cheque is returned by the bank unpaid because of insufficient funds. However, unless the stipulations in the proviso are fulfilled the offence is not deemed to be committed. The conditions in the proviso are as follows: (i) The cheque must be presented in the bank within six months from the date on which it was drawn or within the period of its validity; (ii) The holder of the cheque must make a demand for the payment of the `said amount of money' by giving a notice in writing to the drawer of the cheque within thirty days from the receipt of the notice from the bank that the cheque was returned dishonoured; and (iii) The holder of the cheque fails to make the payment of the `said amount of money' within fifteen days from the receipt of the notice. 11. The primary contention of the first respondent is that the offence under Section 138 was not committed since the amount that was payable to the appellant, as on the date the cheque was presented for encashment, was less than the amount that was represented in the cheque. The question before this Court is whether Section 138 of the Act would still be attracted when the drawer of the cheque makes a part payment towards the debt or liability after the cheque is drawn but before the cheque is encashed, for the dishonour of the cheque which represents the full sum. 12.

Thus, it is crucial that we refer to the law laid down by this Court on the issuance of post-dated cheques and cheques issued for the purpose of security. In Indus Airways Private Limited v. Magnum Aviation Private Limited (2014) 12 SCC 539, the issue before a two-Judge Bench of this Court was whether dishonour of post-dated cheques which were issued by the purchasers towards `advance payment' would be covered by Section 138 of the Act if the purchase order was cancelled subsequently. It was held that Section 138 would only be applicable where there is a legally enforceable debt subsisting on the date when the cheque is drawn. In Sampelly Satyanarayana Rao v. Indian Renewable Energy Development Agency Limited (2016) 10 SCC 458, the respondent advanced a loan for setting up a power project and post-dated cheques were given for security. The cheques were dishonoured and a complaint was instituted under Section 138. Distinguishing Indus Airways (supra), it was held that the test for the application of Section 138 is whether there was a legally enforceable debt on the date mentioned in the cheque. It was held that if the answer is in the affirmative, then the provisions of Section 138 would be attracted. In Sripati Singh v. State of Jharkand 2021 SCC OnLine SC 1002, this Court observed that if a cheque is issued as security and if the debt is not repaid in any other form before the due date or if there is no understanding or agreement between the parties to defer the repayment, the cheque would mature for presentation: \"17. A cheque issued as security pursuant", "page": 10}, {"source": "Dashrath Vs Hitesh 138.pdf", "chunk_id": 1, "text": "if a cheque is issued as security and if the debt is not repaid in any other form before the due date or if there is no understanding or agreement between the parties to defer the repayment, the cheque would mature for presentation: \"17. A cheque issued as security pursuant to a financial transaction cannot be considered as a worthless piece of paper under every circumstance. `Security' in its true sense is the state of being safe and the security given for a loan is something given as a pledge of payment. It is given, deposited or pledged to make certain the fulfilment of an obligation to which the parties to the transaction are bound. If in a transaction, a loan is advanced and the borrower agrees to repay the amount in a specified timeframe and issues a cheque as security to secure such repayment; if the loan amount is not repaid in any other form before the due date or if there is no other understanding or agreement between the parties to defer the payment of amount, the cheque which is issued as security Page 10 of 21 Law Finder DocId # 2046163 Licensed to: Sh.Gurpreet Singh Mann,Advocate Bath... 28-08-2023 Law Finder", "page": 10}, {"source": "Dashrath Vs Hitesh 138.pdf", "chunk_id": 0, "text": "would mature for presentation and the drawee of the cheque would be entitled to present the same. On such presentation, if the same is dishonoured, the consequences contemplated under Section 138 and the other provisions of N.I. Act would flow. 18. When a cheque is issued and is treated as `security' towards repayment of an amount with a time period being stipulated for repayment, all that it ensures is that such cheque which is issued as `security' cannot be presented prior to the loan or the instalment maturing for repayment towards which such cheque is issued as security. Further, the borrower would have the option of repaying the loan amount or such financial liability in any other form and in that manner if the amount of loan due and payable has been discharged within the agreed period, the cheque issued as security cannot thereafter be presented. Therefore, the prior discharge of the loan or there being an altered situation due to which there would be understanding between the parties is a sine qua non to not present the cheque which was issued as security. These are only the defences that would be available to the drawer of the cheque in a proceedings initiated under section 138 of the N.I. Act. Therefore, there cannot be a hard and fast rule that a cheque which is issued as security can never be presented by the drawee of the cheque. If such is the understanding a cheque would also be reduced to an `on demand promissory note' and in all circumstances, it would only be a civil litigation to recover the amount, which is not the intention of the statute.

It is only where the loan is not repaid through any other mode within the due date that the cheque would mature for presentation; and (iii) If the loan has been discharged before the due date or if there is an `altered situation', then the cheque shall not be presented for encashment. 13. In Sunil Todi v. State of Gujarat Criminal Appeal No. 1446 of 2021, a two judge Bench of this Court expounded the meaning of the phrase `debt or other liability'. It was observed that the phrase takes within its meaning a `sum of money promised to be paid on a future day by reason of a present obligation'. The court observed that a post-dated cheque issued after the debt was incurred would be covered within the meaning of `debt'. The court held that Section 138 would also include cases where the debt is incurred after the cheque is drawn but before it is presented for encashment. In this context, it was observed: \"26. The object of the NI Act is to enhance the acceptability of cheques and inculcate faith in the efficiency of negotiable instruments for transaction of business. The purpose of the provision would become otiose if the provision is interpreted", "page": 12}, {"source": "Dashrath Vs Hitesh 138.pdf", "chunk_id": 1, "text": "is presented for encashment.

The purpose of the provision would become otiose if the provision is interpreted to exclude cases where debt is incurred after the drawing of the cheque but before its encashment. In Indus Airways, advance payments were made but since the purchase agreement was cancelled, there was no occasion of incurring any debt. The true purpose of Section 138 would not be fulfilled, if `debt or other liability' is interpreted to include only a debt that exists as on the date of drawing of the cheque. Moreover, Parliament has used the expression `debt or other liability'. The expression Page 12 of 21 Law Finder DocId # 2046163 Licensed to: Sh.Gurpreet Singh Mann,Advocate Bath... 28-08-2023 Law Finder", "page": 12}, {"source": "Dashrath Vs Hitesh 138.pdf", "chunk_id": 0, "text": "\"or other liability' must have a meaning of its own, the legislature having used two distinct phrases. The expression `or other liability' has a content which is broader than `a debt' and cannot be equated with the latter. In the present case, the cheque was issued in close proximity with the commencement of power supply. The issuance of the cheque in the context of a commercial transaction must be understood in the context of the business dealings. The issuance of the cheque was followed close on its heels by the supply of power. To hold that the cheque was not issued in the context of a liability which was being assumed by the company to pay for the dues towards power supplied would be to produce an outcome at odds with the business dealings. If the company were to fail to provide a satisfactory LC and yet consume power, the cheques were capable of being presented for the purpose of meeting the outstanding dues.\" 14. The judgments from Indus Airways (supra) to Sunil Todi (supra) indicate that much of the analysis on whether post-dated cheques issued as security would fall within the purview of Section 138 of the Act hinges on the relevance of time. In Indus Airways (supra), this Court held that for the commission of the offence under Section 138, there must have been a debt on the date of issuance of the cheque. However, later judgments adopt a more nuanced position while discussing the validity of proceedings under Section 138 on the dishonour of post-dated cheques. This Court since Sampelly Satyanarayana Rao (supra) has consistently held that there must be a legally enforceable debt on the date mentioned in the cheque, which is the date of maturity. 15. This Court in NEPC Micon Ltd. v. Magna Leasing", "page": 13}, {"source": "Dashrath Vs Hitesh 138.pdf", "chunk_id": 1, "text": "under Section 138 on the dishonour of post-dated cheques.

This Court in NEPC Micon Ltd. v. Magna Leasing Ltd. AIR 1999 SC 1952 held that the Courts must interpret Section 138 with reference to the legislative intent to supress the mischief and advance the remedy. The objective of the Act in general and Section 138 specifically is to enhance the acceptability of cheques and to inculcate faith in the efficacy of negotiable instruments for the transaction of business. [7*] Section 138 criminalises the dishonour of cheques. This is in addition to the civil remedy that is available. Through the criminalisation of the dishonour of cheques, the legislature intended to prevent dishonesty on the part of the drawer Page 13 of 21 Law Finder DocId # 2046163 Licensed to: Sh.Gurpreet Singh Mann,Advocate Bath... 28-08-2023 Law Finder", "page": 13}, {"source": "Dashrath Vs Hitesh 138.pdf", "chunk_id": 0, "text": "of a negotiable instrument. [8*] The interpretation of Section 138 must not permit dishonesty of the drawee of the cheque as well. A cheque is issued as security to provide the drawee of the cheque with a leverage of using the cheque in case the drawer fails to pay the debt in the future. Therefore, cheques are issued and received as security with the contemplation that a part or the full sum that is addressed in the cheque may be paid before the cheque is encashed. [7* Sunil Sodhi v. State of Gujarat, Criminal Appeal No. 1446 of 2021] [8* M/s Electronics Trade and Technology Development Corporation Ltd., 1996(3) Crimes 82 (SC)] 16. The judgments of this Court on post-dated cheques when read with the purpose of Section 138 indicate that an offence under the provision arises if the cheque represents a legally enforceable debt on the date of maturity. The offence under Section 138 is tipped by the dishonour of the cheque when it is sought to be encashed. Though a post- dated cheque might be drawn to represent a legally enforceable debt at the time of its drawing, for the offence to be attracted, the cheque must represent a legally enforceable debt at the time of encashment. If there has been a material change in the circumstance such that the sum in the cheque does not represent a legally enforceable debt at the time of maturity or encashment, then the offence under Section 138 is not made out. 17. The appellant contended that the cheque was issued by the first respondent on 17 March 2014.

In the testimony recorded under Section 145 of the Act, the appellant stated that he lent the first respondent a sum of rupees twenty lakhs on 16 January 2012 and that the respondent gave a cheque of rupees twenty lakhs stating that it may be deposited on the date specified in it: \"The plaintiff and the Defendant of this case being a Vevai and has a house- like relationship, he has given the amount to the plaintiff as per his requirement on dtd. 16/01/2012 and for the payment of the amount paid by the Plaintiff to the in this case, his bank State Bank of India, AUDa Garden, Prahladnagar Branch, Ahmedabad Cheque Number: 8877828 of Rs. 20,00,000/- (Rupees Twenty Lakhs Only) and stated that the above cheque was deposited by the plaintiff on the date specified in it giving the plaintiff the firm confidence and assurance that the plaintiff would definitely get the amount due from us.\" (emphasis supplied) Further, in the cross-examination, the appellant stated that the amount that was paid by the first respondent was not paid as a reward or gift: \"I cannot say whether the accused has also paid me this amount in the count of Rupees Twenty Lakhs. The accused did not even give me that amount as a reward/gift.\" 20. It was the contention of the first respondent that the cheque was not dated.

It was also categorically recorded by the Courts below that a sum of rupees 4,09,315 that was paid by the first respondent was paid to partly fulfil the debt of rupees twenty lakhs. The appellant in his cross-examination has stated that a `cheque Page 15 of 21 Law Finder DocId # 2046163 Licensed to: Sh.Gurpreet Singh Mann,Advocate Bath... 28-08-2023 Law Finder", "page": 15}, {"source": "Dashrath Vs Hitesh 138.pdf", "chunk_id": 0, "text": "against a cheque' was given when he loaned the sum of rupees twenty lakhs. Thus, it can be concluded that the cheque was given as a security to discharge the loan, either undated or dated as 17 March 2014. Merely because the sum of rupees 4,09,315 was paid between 8 April 2012 and 30 December 2013, which was after 17 March 2014, it cannot be concluded that the sum was not paid in discharge of the loan of rupees twenty lakh. The sum of rupees 4,09,315 was paid after the loan was lent to the first respondent. The appellant in his cross- examination has not denied the receipt of the payments. He has also stated it was not received as a `gift or reward'. In view of the above discussion, at the time of the encashment of the cheque, the first respondent did not owe a sum of rupees twenty lakhs as represented in the cheque at the time of encashment of the cheque that was issued for security. 21. The High Court while dismissing the appeal against acquittal held that the notice issued by the appellant is an omnibus notice since it does not represent a legally enforceable debt. Relying on the judgment of this Court in Rahul Builders v. Arihant Fertilizers & Chemicals (2008) 2 SCC 321, it was held that the legal notice was not issued in accordance with proviso (b) to Section 138 since it did not represent the `correct amount'. The appellant has contended that the requirement under Section 138 is to send a notice demanding the `cheque amount'. It was contended that the offence under Section 138 was made out since the appellant in the statutory notice demanded the payment of rupees twenty lakhs which was the `cheque amount'. 22. Section 138 of the", "page": 16}, {"source": "Dashrath Vs Hitesh 138.pdf", "chunk_id": 1, "text": "the requirement under Section 138 is to send a notice demanding the `cheque amount'. It was contended that the offence under Section 138 was made out since the appellant in the statutory notice demanded the payment of rupees twenty lakhs which was the `cheque amount'. 22. Section 138 of the Act stipulates that if the cheque is returned unpaid by the bank for the lack of funds, then the drawee shall be deemed to have committed an offence under Section 138 of the Act. However, the offence under Section 138 of the Act is attracted only when the conditions in the provisos have been fulfilled. Proviso (b) to Section 138 states that a notice demanding the payment of the `said amount of money' shall be made by the drawee of the cheque. 23. This Court has interpreted the phrase `the said amount of money' as it finds place in proviso (b) to Section 138. In Suman Sethi v. Ajay K Churiwal (2000) 2 SCC 380, the appellant issued a cheque for rupees twenty lakhs in favour of the first respondent. The cheque was dishonoured. A demand notice for an amount Page 16 of 21 Law Finder DocId # 2046163 Licensed to: Sh.Gurpreet Singh Mann,Advocate Bath... 28-08-2023 Law Finder", "page": 16}, {"source": "Dashrath Vs Hitesh 138.pdf", "chunk_id": 0, "text": "higher than the cheque amount was issued. A two-Judge Bench of this Court held that the demand has to be made for the `said amount', which is the cheque amount. It was also observed that the question of whether the notice demanding an amount higher than the cheque amount is valid would depend on the language of the notice: \"8. It is a well-settled principle of law that the notice has to be read as a whole. In the notice, demand has to be made for the \"said amount\" i.e. the cheque amount. If no such demand is made the notice no doubt would fall short of its legal requirement. Where in addition to the \"said amount\" there is also a claim by way of interest, cost etc. whether the notice is bad would depend on the language of the notice. If in a notice while giving the break-up of the claim the cheque amount, interest, damages etc. are separately specified, other such claims for interest, cost etc. would be superfluous and these additional claims would be severable and will not invalidate the notice. If, however, in the notice an omnibus demand is made without specifying what was due under the dishonoured cheque, the notice might well fail to meet the legal requirement and may be regarded as bad.\" 24. In KR Indira v. G. Adinarayana (2003) 8 SCC 300, it was held that the notice did not demand the payment of the cheque amount but the loan amount. It was observed that for the purposes of proviso (b), the amount covered in the dishonoured cheque must be demanded. In Rahul Builders (supra), the drawee demanded the payment of rupees 8,72,409 which was higher than the sum of rupees 1,00,000 represented in the cheque. It was reiterated that the phrase", "page": 17}, {"source": "Dashrath Vs Hitesh 138.pdf", "chunk_id": 1, "text": "was observed that for the purposes of proviso (b), the amount covered in the dishonoured cheque must be demanded. In Rahul Builders (supra), the drawee demanded the payment of rupees 8,72,409 which was higher than the sum of rupees 1,00,000 represented in the cheque. It was reiterated that the phrase `payment of the said amount' in proviso (b) would mean the cheque amount. Since the demand in the notice was not severable as the cheque amount could not be severed from the demand for the additional amount, it was held that it was an omnibus notice. Justice SB Sinha writing for a two-Judge Bench of this Court observed: \"10.

An omnibus notice without specifying as to what was the amount due under the dishonoured cheque would not subserve the requirement of law. Respondent 1 was not called upon to pay the amount which was payable under the cheque issued by it. The amount which it was called upon to pay was the outstanding amounts of bills i.e. Rs 8,72,409. The noticee was to respond to the said demand. Pursuant thereto, it was to offer the entire sum of Rs 8,72,409. No demand was made upon it to pay the said sum of Rs 1,00,000 which was tendered to the complainant by cheque dated 30-4-2000. What was, therefore, demanded was the entire sum and not a part of it.\" 25. Section 138 creates a deeming offence. The provisos prescribe stipulations to safeguard the drawer of the cheque by providing them the opportunity of responding to the notice and an opportunity to repay the cheque amount. The conditions stipulated in the provisos need to be fulfilled in addition to the ingredients in the main provision of Section 138. It has already been concluded above that the offence under Section 138 arises only when a cheque that represents a part or whole of the legally enforceable debt at the time of encashment is returned by the bank unpaid. Since the cheque did not represent the legally enforceable debt at the time of encashment, the offence under Section 138 is not made out. 26. The appellant contends that the purpose of Section 138 of the Act would be defeated if the dishonour of the cheque issued for security is not included", "page": 18}, {"source": "Dashrath Vs Hitesh 138.pdf", "chunk_id": 1, "text": "cheque did not represent the legally enforceable debt at the time of encashment, the offence under Section 138 is not made out. 26. The appellant contends that the purpose of Section 138 of the Act would be defeated if the dishonour of the cheque issued for security is not included within the purview of Section 138 where the payment of a part of the cheque amount is made. It was contended that it would lead to a possibility where the drawer of the cheque could evade prosecution under Section 138 by paying a small amount of the debt while defaulting on the remaining payment. Section 56 stipulates that if there is an endorsement on a negotiable instrument that a part of the sum mentioned in the cheque has been paid, then the instrument may be negotiated for the balance. Section 56 reads as follows: \"56. Indorsement for part of sum due.- No writing on a Page 18 of 21 Law Finder DocId # 2046163 Licensed to: Sh.Gurpreet Singh Mann,Advocate Bath... 28-08-2023 Law Finder", "page": 18}, {"source": "Dashrath Vs Hitesh 138.pdf", "chunk_id": 0, "text": "negotiable instrument is valid for the purpose of negotiation if such writing purports to transfer only a part of the amount appearing to be due on the instrument; but where such amount has been partly paid a note to that effect may be indorsed on the instrument, which may then be negotiated for the balance.\" 27. Section 15 defines the phrase `indorsement' as follows: \"15. Indorsement.- When a maker or holder of a negotiable instrument signs the same, otherwise than as such maker, for the purpose of negotiation, on the back or face thereof or on a slip of paper annexed thereto, or so signs for the same purpose a stamped paper intended to be completed as a negotiable instrument, he is said to indorse the same, and is called the \"indorse\".\" 28. A Division Bench of the Kerala High Court has held in Joseph Sartho v. Gopinathan (2008) 3 KLJ 784 that since the representation in the cheque was for a sum higher than the amount that was due on the date that it was presented for encashment, the drawer of the cheque cannot be convicted for the offence under Section 138 of the Act. The High Court of Delhi addressed the same issue in Alliance Infrastructure Project Ltd. v. Vinay Mittal ILR (2010) III Delhi 459. The High Court observed that when part payment is made after the cheque is drawn, the payee has the option of either taking a new cheque for the reduced amount or by making an endorsement on the cheque acknowledging that a part payment was made according to the provisions of Section 56 of the Act. It was also held that the notice of demand which requires the drawer of the cheque to make payment of the whole amount represented in the cheque", "page": 19}, {"source": "Dashrath Vs Hitesh 138.pdf", "chunk_id": 1, "text": "making an endorsement on the cheque acknowledging that a part payment was made according to the provisions of Section 56 of the Act. It was also held that the notice of demand which requires the drawer of the cheque to make payment of the whole amount represented in the cheque despite receiving part repayment against the sum, before the issue of notice, cannot be valid under Section 138(b) of the Act. A similar view was taken by the High Court of Gujarat in Shree Corporation v. Anilbhai Puranbhai Bansal [2018 (2) GLH 105]. 29. Under Section 56 read with Section 15 of the Act, an endorsement may be made by recording the part-payment of the debt in the cheque or in a note appended to the cheque. When such an endorsement is made, the instrument could still be used to negotiate the balance amount.

Thus, when a part- payment of the debt is made after the cheque was drawn but before the cheque is encashed, such payment must be endorsed on the cheque under Section 56 of the Act. The cheque cannot be presented for encashment without recording the part payment. If the unendorsed cheque is dishonoured on presentation, the offence under Section 138 would not be attracted since the cheque does not represent a legally enforceable debt at the time of encashment. 30. In view of the discussion above, we summarise our findings below: (i) For the commission of an offence under Section 138, the cheque that is dishonoured must represent a legally enforceable debt on the date of maturity or presentation; (ii) If the drawer of the cheque pays a part or whole of the sum between the period when the cheque is drawn and when it is encashed upon maturity, then the legally enforceable debt on the date of maturity would not be the sum represented on the cheque; (iii) When a part or whole of the sum represented on the cheque is paid by the drawer of the cheque, it must be endorsed on the cheque as prescribed in Section 56 of the Act. The cheque endorsed with the payment made may be used to negotiate the balance, if any. If the cheque that is endorsed is dishonoured when it is sought to be encashed upon maturity, then the offence under Section 138 will stand attracted; (iv) The first respondent has made part-payments after the debt was incurred and before the cheque was encashed upon maturity.

ORDER Nobody has appeared on behalf of the respondents, including the Insurance Company (respondent No.6), in spite of service of notice. In these circumstances, we have no option but to proceed ex-parte in the matter. Leave granted. 2. We have heard learned counsel for the appellant and gone through the record. The appellant is a labourer who met with an accident on 18.04.1999 while he was travelling by tractor and trolley bearing No.MH-24-A-6176 and MH-24-A-0218 respectively on Latur - Nanded road from Chikalana village, when a truck bearing No.MH-12-6454 came from behind and rammed into the tractor and trolley in which the appellant was travelling. As a result, the accident occurred and the appellant sustained multiple injuries and he was admitted to Civil Hospital, Latur for medical treatment. The appellant filed the case of compensation under the Motor Vehicles Act before the Motor Accident Claims Tribunal claiming compensation of L 3 lakhs. The Evidence was led by both the parties. The Motor Accident Claims Tribunal on analysing the evidence before it came to the conclusion that the accident took place because of the rash and negligent driving by the driver of the truck as a result of which the appellant had sustained various injuries. The Tribunal also arrived at the conclusion that the income of the appellant was L 21,600/- per annum and by applying multiplier of 18 for loss of income, arrived at a figure of L 2,33,200/- and 60% thereof as the compensation on the ground that disability was 60% and not 100%. In this manner a sum of L 1,72,800/- with interest of 9% from the date of"}, {"source": "Ankush v.

In this manner a sum of L 1,72,800/- with interest of 9% from the date of the petition till realization of the amount in full was awarded to the appellant. After addition of the interest, total sum of L 2,33,200/- was awarded by the Tribunal. 3. Not satisfied with the aforesaid amount of compensation, the appellant preferred an appeal before the High Court. The High Court accepted the finding of the Trial Court that the annual income of the appellant was L 21,600/-, multiplier of 18 was applicable and disability was 60%. Thus award for loss of income in the sum of L 1,72,800/- is maintained. The High Court, however, found that while awarding the amount, no amount towards pains and suffering is awarded nor any amount is awarded towards loss of future prospects and medical expenses. Accordingly, the High Court has awarded a sum of L 20,000/- by way of medical expenses and L 50,000/- towards pains and sufferings and with the addition of further sum of L 50,000/- towards loss of amenities. In the manner, total compensation to the appellant is worked out at L 3,53,200/- with interest @ 9% per annum from the date of petition till realization. 4. Being dissatisfied, the appellant has filed the instant appeal. The counsel for the appellant submitted that though the appellant had suffered 60% disability resulting into loss of right hand, no amount towards loss of future prospects has been awarded by the courts below.

Learned counsel for the appellant is right in his submission. Once we find that there was a permanent disability to the extent of 60% and there is a loss of right hand of the appellant, it is definitely going to affect future prospects of the appellant. 5. We are of the opinion that the ends of justice would be sub-served by giving a consolidated sum of L 1,50,000/- towards loss of future prospects. We are conscious of the fact that the appellant in his petition before the Motor Accident Claims Tribunal was given only an amount of L 3 lakhs. However, in a case like this where the compensation is to be given to the appellant for suffering the accident due to the fault of the driver of the truck and which has resulted in permanent disability to the extent of 60%, we are of the opinion that whatever amount that is legitimately due to the appellant in law should be paid to him and this Court can exercise such power by granting more amount than what he claimed once that amount is found to be due and legitimately payable to the appellant under Article 132 of the Constitution.

Learned Counsel for the appellant submits that there was no dispute that the deceased was a driver and yet the income that is taken by the Tribunal as well as the High Court is L 4,200/-. 2. Learned Counsel appearing for the Insurance Company has brought to our notice the notification issued by the Government of Haryana, Labour Department, where a skilled person in Category `B' has been granted minimum wages to the tune of L 4,360/-. A driver is not a semi-skilled person but a skilled person. Therefore, in any case, we are of the view that the income should have been assessed at L 4,360/- per month. Adding 50 per cent for the future prospects, it comes to L 6,540/-. After deducting 1/4th towards the personal expenses, what would have been saved to the estate would be L 4,905/- per month. Taking the undisputed multiplier of 18, the amount comes to L 10,59,480/-. 3. The High Court has rightly awarded L 1,00,000/- towards loss of consortium to the widow.

When the deceased reached near Gupta Brick Kiln, a jeep bearing registration No.HR-31-A-0426 being driven by respondent No.1 in a rash and negligent manner came from behind and struck the bicycle of deceased.

On account of the death of Hawa Singh, his dependants filed claim petition before the learned Tribunal. Learned Tribunal allowed the same and assessed the annual income of the deceased as Rs.21,600/- and after applying the multiplier of 10, calculated the total dependency of the claimants as Rs.2,16,000/- (Rs.21,600 x 10). It would be appropriate to mention here that as both the sons of the deceased being major were not found to be dependants upon their deceased father, therefore, learned Tribunal applied deduction @ 50% from the annual income of the deceased.

In the present appeal, the appellants/ claimants have sought enhancement of compensation. 5. Learned counsel for both the parties are ad idem that there is no dispute regarding the annual income as well as deduction. However, learned counsel for the claimants/appellants argues that while assessing the annual income, future prospects in view of the judgment of Hon'ble Supreme Court in National Insurance Company Ltd. v. Pranay Sethi and others, 2017 (4) RCR (Civil) 1009 has not been awarded and even the multiplier of 11 needs to be applied. Learned counsel for the appellants further contends that only Rs.10,000/- has been awarded towards funeral, transportation and consortium and no compensation has been awarded under the other conventional heads. Though, present appeal has been filed on behalf of sons of deceased as well, however, in view of the finding of the learned Tribunal, counsel for the claimants/ appellants has not pressed the issue regarding their dependency. 6. Learned counsel for respondent No.1 submits that compensation awarded by the learned Tribunal is just and fair and therefore, no interference is warranted. 7. Having heard the arguments advanced by learned counsel for both the parties and gone through the paper-book, I am of the considered view that as the age of the deceased at the time of accident was held to be about 54-55 years by the learned Tribunal, being self-employed, as such, 10% of annual income should have been awarded on account of future prospects. 8.

Pleaded case of the plaintiff is that the plaintiff is running a medical centre at 5/3, Section 3, Ballabgarh in the name and style of \u201cSirohi Medical Centre\u201d. Electricity connection bearing account No.HU-21/0050 was installed in the premises in the year 2002. Plaintiff has been making payment of electricity charges regularly. However on 21.05.2009, defendant No.3 along with its other officials visited the premises of the plaintiff and reported that the seals of the meter seemed to be tampered with. The electricity meter was removed and a new meter was installed in place. It was alleged that consumer was running excess load of 26.99 KW instead of sanctioned load of 10 KW. Old meter was sent to laboratory for checking. However, no defect was found in accuracy of meter within permissible limits. Therefore, checking report issued by the defendants was claimed to be illegal, arbitrary and consequently demand notice, calling upon the plaintiff to pay fine of Rs.13,43,179/- was claimed to be set aside. [4]. Defendants contested the suit by taking preliminary objections regarding maintainability, jurisdiction, estoppel, concealment of facts. On merits it was alleged that Vigilance Team found running of excess load by the consumer on 21.05.2009 as the connected load was found to be 26.99 KW against sanctioned load of 10 KW. The M&T Lab report dated 22.05.2009 found that both the firm seals were tampered and meter body was also found to be tampered. A case of theft of energy by tampering meter seals was found.

Thus, demand raised by the defendants was claimed to be valid. [5]. Trial Court framed the following issues:- \u201c1.

The trial Court vide judgment and decree dated 18.04.2012 partly decreed the suit on the ground that report of M&T Lab Ex.P-12 showed accuracy of meter within limits and, therefore, penalty for commission of alleged theft of energy could not have been imposed upon the plaintiff. The defendants could have asked for compounding fee of Rs.10,000/- per KW on the excess load connected to the meter. Evidently the sanctioned load of the premises of the plaintiff was 10 KW. [7].

Trial Court dealt with this issue and found that it is a case of running of excess load on the connection and not a case of theft of energy and the plaintiff had sought declaration qua the demand notice being illegal and arbitrary and has proved the same to some extent.

Since the plaintiff had already deposited an amount of Rs.6,72,000/- as per receipt Ex.P-31 in compliance to order dated 29.05.2009 passed by the trial Court, therefore, defendants were directed to refund the excess amount deposited by the plaintiff after adjusting the compounding fee in accordance with law.

Before embarking upon the issues involved in case it is relevant to consider material on record. [14]. Checking report dated 21.05.2009 showed that meter body and seals seemed to be tampered.

As per report of M&T Lab both the firm seals were found to be tampered, meter body was also found tampered, in the column of remarks accuracy of meter was found within limits.

Singh-DW-1 highlighted that he was heading Vigilance Team at the time of checking of the premises of the plaintiff. Witness admitted in his cross-examination that 3 phase meter was installed in the premises of the plaintiff. There were five seals. Two seals besides that were fixed by Nigam.

Tampering of body has not come forth in terms of any particular specification and, therefore, cannot be taken to be qualified word in order to give exact meaning to the alleged tampering. [17]. The witness admitted that no theft was being committed and it was a case of excess running of load of 26.99 KW in place of sanctioned load of 10 KW. The witness further admitted in his cross- examination that the accuracy of the meter was found to be within permissible limits and the alleged tampering of body has not been elaborated within defined meaning by means of qualified words, tampering of two seals out of total seven seals could not have projected a case of theft of energy particularly when inflow of energy in the premises was being correctly measured by the meter and its accuracy was found to be well within permissible limits. [18]. At the time of inspection no shunt connection was found, rather running of excess load on sanctioned load of 10 KW was only found. Five seals were found intact, therefore, it was not a case of theft of energy.

Apparently Sections 126 and 135 of the 2003 Act if read together would constitute a complete code in themselves covering all relevant consideration for passing of an order of assessment in cases which do not fall under Section 135 of the 2003 Act. There is mark distinction in the contents of Section 126 and Section 135 of 2003 Act. Both are distinct and different provision, which operate in different field having no common premise in law. Theft has been defined in Section 135 of the 2003 Act which falls under part XIV relating to offences and penalties. Title of Section is 'theft of electricity'. The word 'dishonestly' appearing in the Section denotes abstract or consumption or use of electricity by dishonest means which is punishable under Section 135 of the 2003 Act. The mechanism for dealing under Section 135 of 2003 Act is based on dishonest abstraction and consumption of energy. Besides imposition of punishment as specified under these provisions or the proviso thereto, Section (1A) of Section 135 of the 2003 Act provides that without prejudice to the provisions of the 2003 Act, licensee or 10 of 15 ::: Downloaded on - 11-10-2017 19:11:14 :::", "page": 10}, {"source": "Dakshin Haryana Bijli Vs.

The fine which may be imposed under Section 135 of the 2003 Act is directly proportional to the number of convictions and is also dependent on the extent of load abstracted. [21]. Contra to the aforesaid provisions, Section 126 of the 2003 Act would be applicable to the cases where there is no theft of energy but energy is being consumed in violation of terms and conditions of supply leading to authorised used of energy. Such malpractice squarely falls within the expression 'unauthorised use of electricity'. The proceeding would start with the inspection of the premises by an Assessing Officer and he would record the finding that the consumer is indulging in unauthorised use of energy. The Assessing Officer shall provisionally assess to the best of his judgment, the electricity charges payable by such consumer as well as pass a provisional assessment order in terms of Section 126(2) of the 2003 Act. The Officer is also under obligation to serve a notice in terms of Section 126(3) of the 2003 Act on the consumer, requiring him to file his objections, if any against the provisional assessment before passing of final order of assessment within 30 days of from the date of service of such order of provisional assessment.

The explanation to Section 126 of the 2003 Act is of some significance. Section 126 of the 2003 Act falls under chapter XII and relates to investigation and enforcement and empowers the Assessing Officer to pass order of assessment, whereas Section 135 of 2003 Act deals with an offence of theft of energy and the penalty that can be imposed for such theft. This falls under the domain of criminal jurisprudence where mens rea is one of the relevant factor for finding a case of theft. Section 126 of the 2003 Act does not talk about any criminal intendment and primarily revolves around an action and remedy available under civil law. It does not have any mens rea or the ailments which are traceable to the criminal concept of mens rea. [23]. In this way Section 126 of the 2003 Act deals with cases of unauthorised use of energy in the absence of intention/mens rea whereas Section 135 of the 2003 Act deals with an offence of theft of energy where mens rea is the relevant factor. The cases under Section 126 of the 2003 Act would certainly be different from the cases where dishonest abstraction of electricity by means of artificial methods enlisted under Section 135 of the 2003 Act. [24]. Consumption of excessive load as against sanctioned load simpliciter would attract applicability in terms of Section 126 of the 2003 Act.

[25]. Section 135 of the 2003 Act uses the word 'whoever, dishonestly' does any act of the listed actions so as to abstract or consume electricity would be punished in accordance with provisions of the 2003 Act. In this way a distinction has been made between Sections 126 and 135 of the 2003 Act which operate in different fields and have no overlapping mechanism. [26]. In the instant case, since no evidence of direct connection/shunt connection or direct connection bypassing the installed meter, has been found, therefore, the case does not fall under any of the listed actions so as to abstract or consume electricity. Finding the meter to be running on genuine parameters is a fact in addition to aforesaid phenomena which makes the present case distinct from the applicability of Section 135 of the 2003 Act. The ambit and scope under Section 126 of the 2003 Act with reference to the construction of the words 'unauthorised use' and 'means' are to be judged differently from the words 'whoever, dishonestly' does any act of listed actions so as to abstract or consume electricity which falls under the ambit of Section 135 of the 2003 Act.

Therefore, whenever the consumer consumes electricity in excess of the maximum of the contracted load would be governed by Section 126 of the 2003 Act unless and until he is found to have abstracted or using electricity dishonestly in terms of any of the listed actions under Section 135 of the Act, like providing for direct connection bypassing the installed meter that is where the consumer, by any of the means and methods as specified under Section 135(a) to 135 (e) of the 2003 Act as abstracted energy with dishonest intention without authorisation. Highlighted mechanism is based on the interpretation given by the Apex Court in Executive Engineer and another v. M/s Sri Seetaram Rice Mill, 2012(1) Law Herald (SC) 205. [28]. The remaining question with regard to jurisdiction of the civil Court has to be answered in the light of nature of notice issued to the plaintiff by the defendants. The very nature of the notice shows absurdity thereby mixing both the provision. If the Authority acts illegally and in violation of principles of natural justice, civil Court has got jurisdiction under Section 9 CPC. Section 152 of the 2003 Act provides for compounding of offences and special Courts are to be constituted for speedy disposal under Sections 135 to 142 and 150 of the 2003 Act. Since the compounding fee has already been deposited the case squarely falls under under the ambit of Section 126 of the 2003 Act. [29].

The defendants have raised illegal demand of huge amount of penalty on account of alleged theft of energy which is against the scheme of the 2003 Act. The bar of civil Court jurisdiction is only applicable where dispute falls within the purview of Section 126 of the 2003 Act. The demand of illegal amount is based on allegation of theft of energy, therefore, the contemplating action does not falls within the purview of Section 126 of the 2003 Act and the civil Court jurisdiction to entertain such a relief is maintainable. Reference can be made to Dakshin Haryana Bijli Vitran Nigam Limited v. Poonam Vashisth, 2009(2) CivCC 131. [30]. Since the impugned action of the defendants is based on wrong categorisation of case in view of inspection and the contemplated action cannot be treated to be a mechanism evolved in terms of Section 126 of the 2003 Act, therefore, in the light of principles as discussed above, the impugned action is not sustainable in law and bar of civil Court jurisdiction is not at all attracted. [31]. In view of above, this appeal is found to totally bereft of merits and the same is accordingly dismissed.
